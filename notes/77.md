The universal way
is like an archer
who pulls down the top,
lifts up the bottom,
releases when there's plenty,
draws when there's not enough.
天之道其猶張弓與
高者抑之
下者舉之
有餘者損之
不足者補之

Since the universal way
takes the extra
and puts it where there's not enough,
the human way is unnatural
because it takes from the poor
and serves the rich.
天之道損有餘而補不足
人之道則不然
損不足以奉有餘

How can we have plenty
and share what the universe offers?
Only by following the way.
孰能有餘以奉天下
唯有道者

So the wise take but don't keep it,
build but don't stay there,
and don't expect to get credit for it.
是以聖人為而不恃
功成而不處
其不欲見賢
