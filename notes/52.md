Society exists for a reason.
Think of it as society's mother.
When you recognize the mother,
you'll understand her children,
and when you understand her children,
you'll protect them from the mother,
but you'll never be in danger.
天下有始以為天下母
既得其母以知其子
既知其子復守其母
沒身不殆

You'll shutter the windows and bar the gate
but you won't worry about anything.
You'll open the shutters and support the cause,
but you won't save anyone.
塞其兌 閉其門 終身不勤
開其兌 濟其事 終身不救

Looking after for the weak
is called wisdom,
and protecting the vulnerable
is called strength.
見小曰明
守柔曰強

Shine the light,
you'll go back to the wisdom
but you won't get left behind.
This one's called Xichang, practice makes perfect.
用其光
復歸其明
無遺身殃
是為習常
