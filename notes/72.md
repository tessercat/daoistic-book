When people don't fear your power,
you've become truly powerful.
Without coveting their property,
without resenting their achievements,
above all don't resent them
so you're not resented.
民不畏威則大威至
無狎其所居
無厭其所生
夫唯不厭
是以不厭

So the wise
have opinions, but don't share them,
have feelings, but don't indulge them,
so ignore them,
heed this.
是以聖人自知不自見
自愛不自貴
故去彼取此
