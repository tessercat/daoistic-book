Nothing about politics
is meek and mild like water,
but to chasten pride and power,
nothing beats it
because it's impossible to ignore.
天下莫柔弱於水
而攻堅強者莫之能勝
其無以易之

The meek do it to master the strong,
the mild do it to convince the stubborn.
No one in politics is unaware of it
but no one can apply it.
弱之勝強
柔之勝剛
天下莫不知
莫能行

Since the words of the wise tell us that
taking society's crap
is what it means to be
a knight of the realm,
[receiving the country's misfortune]
is what it means to be
king of the world,
是以聖人云
受國之垢是謂社稷主
受國不祥是謂天下王

the right words seem wrong.
正言若反
