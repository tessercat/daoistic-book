Honesty isn't flattering,
flattery isn't honest.
Certainty isn't tolerant,
tolerance isn't sure.
Doing good doesn't do a lot,
doing a lot doesn't do any good.
信言不美 美言不信
善者不辯 辯者不善
知者不博 博者不知

The wise don't have a lot.
By considering others,
they have more for themselves.
By giving to others,
they do a lot more for themselves.
聖人不積
既以為人己愈有
既以與人己愈多

The universal way
helps and doesn't harm.
The way of the wise
follows along and doesn't struggle against it.
天之道利而不害
聖人之道為而不爭。
