Honesty isn't flattering,
flattery isn't honest.
Certainty isn't tolerant,
tolerance isn't sure.
Doing good doesn't do a lot,
doing a lot doesn't do any good.
信言不美 美言不信
善者不辯 辯者不善
知者不博 博者不知

The wise don't have a lot.
By considering others,
they have more for themselves.
By giving to others,
they do a lot more for themselves.
聖人不積
既以為人己愈有
既以與人己愈多

The universal way
helps and doesn't harm.
The way of the wise
follows along and doesn't struggle against it.
天之道利而不害
聖人之道為而不爭。

# Notes

Mawangdui B
alters the order of the three sayings
compared to Wangbi and Heshanggong,
and pairs 多 with 善 instead of 辯.
(There's no Mawangdui A version
of this poem.)
I like how Mawangdui's
use of 多,
and its ordering of the sayings,
leads nicely
to the next saying about
how the wise get ahead,
so I've used 多
and kept the Mawangdui ordering
in my own version.

Mawangdui compares
天之道 to 人之道
in the final saying,
but Wangbi and Heshanggong both compare
天之道 to 聖人之道.
Since the only other poem
to use the term 人之道 (77)
uses it to explain that 人之道
isn't like 天之道 at all,
I've gone with 聖人之道 here.

(I think this dim view of human nature
must have been quite common.
See, for example,
[Wenzi 上德 5](https://daoistic.ca/blog/studies/philosophy "Read The Philosophy of Heaven and Earth")'s riff
on 77 that includes the striking phrase,
人之道多者不與.
