We come out and live,
go back when we die.
出生入死

Three in ten fight to live,
three in ten long for death,
three in ten love life so much it kills them.
生之徒十有三
死之徒十有三
人之生動之死地十有三

But why are they like that?
They're alive, so they're full of life.
夫何故
以其生
生之厚

Maybe you've heard of
people who are good at staying alive.
They travel the world
but don't face bulls or tigers.
They join the army
but don't carry shields or weapons.
There's nothing for bulls to smash with their horns,
nothing for tigers to catch in their claws,
nothing for soldiers to hack with their swords.
But why are they like that?
They have nothing left to kill.
蓋聞善攝生者
陸行不遇兕虎
入軍不被甲兵
兕無所投其角
虎無所措其爪
兵無所容其刃
夫何故
以其無死地
