True success seems lacking.
Achieving it doesn't hurt anyone.
True fulfillment seems boring.
Achieving it doesn't degrade anyone.
True skill seems crude.
True wit seems humble.
True piety seems forgiving.
Warm beats cold,
peace beats passion.
Peace and quiet
keep the world on track.
大成若缺其用不弊
大盈若沖其用不窮
大直若屈
大巧若拙
大辯若訥
躁勝寒靜勝熱
清靜為天下正
