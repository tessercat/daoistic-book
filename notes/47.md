Don’t step out the door
to understand the world.
Don’t peer through a telescope
to understand the universe.
Stepping outside is even more isolating,
understanding is even more humbling.
不出戶知天下
不闚牖見天道
其出彌遠
其知彌少

So the wise
don’t go anywhere but understand,
aren't understood but have a good reputation,
don’t do anything but get things done.
是以聖人
不行而知
不見而名
不為而成
