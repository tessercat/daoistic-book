Brevity is natural.
Strong winds don't last the morning,
heavy rain doesn't last the day.
希言自然
故飄風不終朝
驟雨不終日

What does that mean?
Even heaven and earth
can't last forever.
How are people any different?
So devoted servants of Dao
stick to the road,
the moral stick to morality,
skeptics stick to doubt.
To the moral,
the road is good to you too.
To the skeptics,
the road doesn't believe in you either.
孰為此者
天地
天地尚不能久而況於人乎
故從事於道者
道者同於道
德者同於德
失者同於失

同於道者道亦樂得之
同於德者德亦樂得之
同於失者失亦樂得之

信不足焉有不信焉
