Gushen, immortal nature goddess,
call her Xuanpin, the female principle.
Xuanpin's teachings,
call them the philosophy of heaven and earth.
谷神不死是謂玄牝
玄牝之門是謂天地根

Known far and wide, they seem eternal.
Learning them isn't hard.
綿綿若存
用之不勤

# Notes

谷神 is normally translated
as "valley spirit".
Context and ctext
make me think
the term refers to
something like
an agriculture or fertility deity.

See [chapter 1](/studies/1)
for my thoughts on
玄 terms like 玄牝.
in the _Dao De Jing_.
