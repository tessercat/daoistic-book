Laozi on micromanaging.

This two-part blog post is my interpretation of the ctext version of a passage from Wenzi, a Daoist leadership manual from the 700s.

I've only read a few Wenzi passages in detail, but this one seems pretty typical. Passages start with a pithy saying of Laozi and explain and expound a moral lesson, often to illustrate a saying from the Dao De Jing. The passages are about society, government, leadership, public service, or just how to be a decent human being.

Interpretations are my own, and I make no claim of academic or moral merit. I try to stay as true as I can to the patterns and vocabulary of the original, but English is my one and only language and passages like this are part of a deep tradition that I don't really understand.

But the more I read, the more I see literature in there, a manifesto, refined over centuries, a clear expression of a wisdom tradition that knows a thing or two about what it means to be a moral person and what it takes to build lasting institutions and societies. I don't claim to be that or to have done that, but I feel compelled to channel its pithy, jazzy wisdom as faithfully and readably as I can into my own language, probably only because I'm the one who needs it most.
