The world is on the right track
when old pack horses graze the pasture.
The world has lost its way
when war horses breed in the fields.
天下有道卻走馬以糞
天下無道戎馬生於郊

There's nothing more painful than never being satisfied
and no fate more tragic than a dream come true,
so be thankful for having enough,
that's always enough.
禍莫大於不知足
咎莫大於欲得
故知足之足常足矣
