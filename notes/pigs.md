鄭有神巫曰季咸
知人之生死存亡，
禍福壽夭，
期以歲月旬日，
若神。

In Cheng there was a shaman of the gods named Chi Hsien.
He could tell whether men would live or die, survive or perish, 
be fortunate or unfortunate, live a long time or die young,
and he would predict the year, month, week, and day as though he were a god himself.

鄭人見之，
皆棄而走。

When the people of Cheng saw him,
they dropped everything and ran out of his way.

列子見之而心醉，
歸以告壺子，曰：
「始吾以夫子之道為至矣，
則又有至焉者矣。」

Lieh Tzu went to see him and was completely intoxicated.
Returning, he said to Hu Tzu,
"I used to think, Master, that your Way was perfect.
But now I see there is something even higher!"

壺子曰：
「吾與汝既其文，
未既其實，
而固得道與？」
眾雌而無雄，
而又奚卵焉！
而以道與世亢必信，
夫故使人得而相女。
嘗試與來，以予示之。」

Hu Tzu said,
"I have already showed you all the outward forms,
but I haven't yet showed you the substance
and do you really think you have mastered this Way of mine?
There may be a flock of hens but, if there is no rooster,
how can they lay fertile eggs?
You take what you know of the Way and wave it in the face of the world, expecting to be believed!
This is the reason men can see right through you.
Try bringing your shaman along next time and letting him get a look at me."

明日，
列子與之見壺子。
出而謂列子曰：
「嘻！子之先生死矣，
弗活矣，
不以旬數矣！
吾見怪焉，
見溼灰焉。」

The next day
Lieh Tzu brought the shaman to see Hu Tzu.
When they had left the room, the shaman said,
"I'm so sorry - your master is dying!
There's no life left in him -
he won't last the week.
I saw something very strange-
something like wet ashes!"

列子入，
泣涕沾襟，
以告壺子。
壺子曰：
「鄉吾示之以地文，
萌乎不震不正。
是殆見吾杜德機也。
嘗又與來。」

Lieh Tzu went back into the room,
weeping and drenching the collar of his robe with tears,
and reported this to Hu Tzu.
Hu Tzu said,
"Just now I appeared to him with the Pattern of Earth - 
still and silent, nothing moving, nothing standing up.
He probably saw in me the Workings of Virtue Closed Off.
Try bringing him around again."

明日，
又與之見壺子。
出而謂列子曰：
「幸矣！
子之先生遇我也。
有瘳矣，
全然有生矣。
吾見其杜權矣。」

The next day
the two came to see Hu Tzu again,
and when they had left the room, the shaman said to Lieh Tzu,
"It certainly was lucky that your master met me!
He's going to get better - he has all the signs of life! I could see the stirring of what had been closed off!"

列子入，
以告壺子。
壺子曰：
「鄉吾示之以天壤，
名實不入，
而機發於踵。
是殆見吾善者機也。
嘗又與來。」

Lieh Tzu went in
and reported this to Hu Tzu.
Hu Tzu said,
"Just now I appeared to him as Heaven and Earth - 
no name or substance to it,
but still the workings, coming up from the heels.
He probably saw in me the Workings of the Good One.
Try bringing him again."

明日，
又與之見壺子。
出而謂列子曰：
「子之先生不齊，
吾無得而相焉。
試齊，
且復相之。」

The next day
the two came to see Hu Tzu again,
and when they had left the room, the shaman said to Lieh Tzu,
"Your master is never the same!
I have no way to physiognomize him!
If he will try to steady himself,
then I will come and examine him again."

列子入，
以告壺子。
壺子曰：
「吾鄉示之以太沖莫勝。
是殆見吾衡氣機也。
鯢桓之審為淵，
止水之審為淵，
流水之審為淵。
淵有九名，
此處三焉。
嘗又與來。」

Lieh Tzu went in
and reported this to Hu Tzu.
Hu Tzu said,
"Just now I appeared to him as the Great Vastness Where Nothing Wins Out.
He probably saw in me the Workings of the Balanced Breaths.
Where the swirling waves gather there is an abyss;
where the still waters gather there is an abyss;
where the running waters gather there is an abyss.
The abyss has nine names
and I have shown him three.
Try bringing him again."

明日，
又與之見壺子。
立未定，
自失而走。
壺子曰：
「追之！」
列子追之不及，
反以報壺子，曰：
「已滅矣，
已失矣，
吾弗及也。」

The next day
the two came to see Hu Tzu again,
but before the shaman had even come to a halt before Hu Tzu,
his wits left him and he fled.
said Hu Tzu,
"Run after him!"
but though Lieh Tzu ran after him,
he could not catch up.
Returning, he reported to Hu Tzu,
"He's vanished!
He's disappeared!
I couldn't catch up with him."

壺子曰：
「鄉吾示之以未始出吾宗。
吾與之虛而委蛇，
不知其誰何，
因以為弟靡，
因以為波流，
故逃也。」

Hu Tzu said,
"Just now I appeared to him as Not Yet Emerged from My Source.
I came at him empty, wriggling and turning,
not knowing anything about `who' or `what,'
now dipping and bending,
now flowing in waves -
that's why he ran away."

然後
列子自以為未始學
而歸
三年不出

After that,
Liezi realized that he hadn't even begun to learn,
so he went home
and didn't leave for three years.

為其妻爨
食豕如食人

He cooked for his wife
and treated pigs like people.

於事無與親
彫琢復朴

He didn't get attached to his work
and his polish became plain.

塊然獨以其形立
紛然而封哉
一以是終

Independent and solitary in his habits,
scattered yet secure,
he was whole in the end.
