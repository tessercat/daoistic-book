The adventurous get slaughtered,
the unadventurous stay safe.
Some are helped by this,
some are harmed.
Who knows what provokes the wrath of God?
勇於敢則殺
勇於不敢則活
此兩者或利或害
天之所惡
孰知其故

是以聖人猶難之

The universal way
isn't warlike, but it's overpowering,
isn't demanding, but it's very convincing,
doesn't summon us, but comes in person,
makes war, but very cunningly.
God casts a wide net.
It's loose, but it doesn't miss.
天之道
不爭而善勝
不言而善應
不召而自來
繟然而善謀
天網恢恢
踈而不失
