Everyone says I'm important,
important, but odd.
Above all I'm important because I'm odd.
If I were normal for long,
I'd be irrelevant, wouldn't I?
天下皆謂我道大
似不肖
夫唯大
故似不肖
若肖久矣
其細也夫

I always have three treasures,
I maintain them and keep them safe.
The first is caution,
the second is restraint,
the third is not trying to get ahead in the world.
我有三寶
持而保之
一曰慈
二曰儉
三曰不敢為天下先

In the end, caution lets me be brave,
restraint lets me be generous,
not trying to get ahead in the world
lets me do excellent work.
慈故能勇
儉故能廣
不敢為天下先
故能成器長

These days,
when people refuse to be cautious
and insist on courage,
refuse to hold back
and insist on going for it,
refuse to go last
and insist on going first,
they end up dead.
今舍慈且勇
舍儉且廣
舍後且先
死矣

In the end,
caution in war leads to victory,
in defense, to safety.
夫慈以戰則勝
以守則固

The universe empowers us
when caution protects us.
天將救之以慈衛之
