Honour or life,
which is more important?
Health or money,
which is more valuable?
Winning or losing,
which is more trouble?
名與身孰親
身與貨孰多
得與亡孰病

True love is so expensive
and a huge fortune is so much to lose.
是故甚愛必大費；
藏必厚亡

Being content and not being ashamed,
and knowing when to quit and not taking risks
are what it takes to make them grow and last.
知足不辱
知止不殆
可以長久
