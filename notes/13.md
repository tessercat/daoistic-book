Privilege is as dangerous as punishment,
virtue is as personal as suffering.
寵辱若驚
貴大患若身

What were they saying
about privilege and punishment?
Privilege is a put down.
When getting it was trouble
and forgetting it was trouble,
they were right to say
that privilege and punishment are dangerous.
何謂寵辱若驚
寵為下
得之若驚
失之若驚
是謂寵辱若驚

Why did they say
that virtue is as personal as suffering?
It's painful to me
when I take it personally.
When I don't take it personally,
why should I care?
何謂貴大患若身
吾所以有大患者
為吾有身
及吾無身
吾有何患

That's why my virtue takes it personally
when I'm responsible for society,
and my compassion takes it personally
when I'm committed to society.
故貴以身為天下若可寄天下
愛以身為天下若可託天下
