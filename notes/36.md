Trying to control them
provokes them.

Trying to weaken them
strengthens them.

Trying to hurt them
helps them.

Trying to divide them
unites them.

They call that
a glimmer of enlightenment.

The meek
conquer the mighty.

The whale
mustn't leave the deep.

The power of the state
can't be used
to show people the way.

將欲歙之必固張之
將欲弱之必固強之
將欲廢之必固興之
將欲奪之必固與之
是謂微明

柔弱勝剛強

魚不可脫於淵
國之利器不可以示人
