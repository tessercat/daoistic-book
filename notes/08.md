The best are like water.
Water helps everything
and doesn't fight.
Follow its example
by turning the other cheek.
上善若水
水善利萬物而不爭
處衆人之所惡
故幾於道

Good habits are steady,
good minds are open,
good gifts are kind,
good words are honest,
good rules are fair,
good work is useful,
good action is timely.
居善地
心善淵
與善仁
言善信
正善治
事善能
動善時

Above all, not fighting
means not holding grudges.
夫唯不爭
故無尤
