Heaven and earth aren't humane.
They treat everything as straw dogs.
The wise aren't humane.
They treat citizens as straw dogs.
天地不仁以萬物為芻狗
聖人不仁以百姓為芻狗

Between heaven and earth,
isn't it like a bellows?
Empty, but it doesn't collapse.
Squeeze and more comes out.
天地之間其猶橐籥乎
虛而不屈
動而愈出

Barking orders, placing blame,
that's not the same as staying neutral.
多言數窮
不如守中
