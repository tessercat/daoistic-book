Heaven and earth aren't humane.
They treat everything as straw dogs.
The wise aren't humane.
They treat citizens as straw dogs.
天地不仁以萬物為芻狗
聖人不仁以百姓為芻狗

Between heaven and earth,
isn't it like a bellows?
Empty, but it doesn't collapse.
Squeeze and more comes out.
天地之間其猶橐籥乎
虛而不屈
動而愈出

Barking orders, placing blame,
that's not the same as staying neutral.
多言數窮
不如守中

# Notes

百姓 is literally the hundred clans.
Here,
and in 17, 49 and 75,
百姓 is citizens.

According to Kroll,
a possible reading of 數窮
is to enumerate faults,
and the phrase appears in Wenzi and Lushi Chunchiu
as something bosses do to servants:
數窮於下.
I think it's something like
finding fault with subordinates,
blaming and berating them.

多言 also appears
in a few places in ctext
as something that people do
and regret immediately.
I think it's something like
lecturing and 'splaining
and generally being a pompous ass.
