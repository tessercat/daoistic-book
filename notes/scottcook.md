Hi Scott, I'm a fan of your Guodian books,
and I thought I'd reach out and thank you
for the incredible footnotes you put together
for your translation of the Dao De Jing.

I'm a Canadian software developer
with an interest in history,
and about six years ago,
I thought I'd look online
for the Dao De Jing's source code.
I found it at https://ctext.org,
and it made no sense at all,
but I loved how patterned it was,
so I put the characters in a database
and made a few queries.
I was intrigued enough
to learn how characters were put together,
to buy Paul Kroll's dictionary (also wow),
and to read a couple of first year grammars.

I heard you on a podcast a few years ago,
so I ordered your Guodian books,
and your footnotes are just... incredible.
They shed so much light on what the experts are thinking,
and I had already spent a lot of time
staring at the poems,
so your footnotes helped me realize
that I had actually considered
many of the interpretations they offered.
They also encouraged me to realize
that I was going to have to live with ambiguity,
but also that perhaps I wasn't on a fools errand after all,
or if I was,
that so was everyone else.

I'm terrible at it, of course.
I came to it far too late in life
ever to read fluently,
but what I lack in skill and fluency,
I make up in technical crutches and determination.
I'm just so compelled to try to understand
the point of view.
I try to stay as analytical as possible,
but I find that what I read
often applies in my life,
and I'm a better person for it.
I can't help but think
they were on to something.

I'm fairly comfortable by now
with my own interpretation
of much of the Dao De Jing,
though I often discover something new
that shifts my perspective,
and I doubt that will stop happening
any time soon.
I've also discovered Wenzi and Huainanzi
from character searches in ctext,
and I've read a few Wenzi passages quite closely.

I looked for you online a while ago
and noticed your email address
in the languages contact page
for Yale NUS College,
so I thought I should thank you
for the part you've played
in this journey I've been on.
So thank you,
and keep up the good work :)
