Govern people to serve God,
there's nothing like hard times.
After all,
hardship
means making do.
Making do
means saving up.
治人事天莫若嗇
夫唯嗇
是謂早服
早服謂之重積德

If we save up,
nothing's impossible.
If nothing's impossible,
no one knows our fate.
重積德則無不克
無不克則莫知其極

Not knowing our fate
could mean leading a nation.
The principles of leading nations
could mean it lasts a long time.
莫知其極
可以有國
有國之母
可以長久

This one's called,
Strong fundamentals,
healthy relationships,
the Dao of a long and healthy life.
是謂深根固柢
長生久視之道
