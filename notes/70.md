Our orders are very easy to understand,
very easy to follow,
but it's impossible for people to understand them,
impossible to follow them.
The orders are ancient,
the mission is just,
and above all, unknowable,
so we don't reveal them.
吾言甚易知甚易行
天下莫能知莫能行
言有宗
事有君
夫唯無知
是以不我知

They less they know,
they more they respect us,
so the wise
wear plain clothes
and conceal jade.
知我者希則我者貴
是以聖人被褐懷玉
