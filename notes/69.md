They had something to say about waging war.
用兵有言

I won't risk playing the host but I'll play the guest,
I won't risk advancing an inch but I'll retreat a foot.
They called that
marching without orders,
taking without force,
occupying without soldiers,
advancing without enemies.
吾不敢為主而為客
不敢進寸而退尺
是謂行無行
攘無臂
扔無敵
執無兵

There's no greater mistake
than underestimating the enemy.
Scoffing at the enemy is a sign
that I've lost the advantage
because when opposing armies meet,
the aggrieved one wins.
禍莫大於輕敵
輕敵幾喪吾寶
故抗兵相加
哀者勝矣
