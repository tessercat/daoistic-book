In the old days,
good leaders must have been
quietly curious,
deeply intelligent,
ultimately inscrutable,
so loud sing their praise.
古之善為士者微妙玄通
深不可識
夫唯不可識
故強為之容

As cautious as a winter crossing,
as diplomatic as a dangerous neighbourhood.
As brave as apostles,
as chill as ice,
as true as timber,
as messy as mud.
豫兮若冬涉川
猶兮若畏四鄰
儼兮其若容
渙兮若冰之將釋
敦兮其若樸
曠兮其若谷
混兮其若濁

As meltwater always clears very slowly in stillness,
as patterns always emerge very slowly when it moves?
孰能濁以靜之徐清
孰能安以久動之徐生

Those of us who preserve their ways
aren't perfectionists.
Above all, imperfection
means we can fail,
but not start from scratch.
保此道者不欲盈
夫唯不盈
故能蔽不新成

# Notes

On the watery virtues
of anonymous saints of old.

As in
chapter 8,
they took people's shit,
decontaminated themselves
in quiet solitude
and took action
only to restore balance.

I'm finding it very difficult
to find words in English
to express the 盈 saying succinctly.

I think it's a saying
for those of us who inherited
the mess left to us
by those who came before.
It's a reminder that
we'll never perfect it,
never finish it,
but that's OK,
because that's what lasts.
Everything good
is flexible
and it adapts,
but only to restore balance.
It's flawed and incomplete,
and it's not modern,
never shiny and new.
