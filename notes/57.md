Lead the nation predictably,
wage war unpredictably,
conquer the world by doing nothing.
以正治國
以奇用兵
以無事取天下

How do I know it's true?
Like this.
吾何以知其然哉
以此

When the world has too many morals,
people
When people profit instruments,
the country is dark.
When people are too talented and clever,
strange things start happening.
When laws pass,
too many thieves and bandits exist.
天下多忌諱而民彌貧
民多利器
國家滋昏
人多伎巧
奇物滋起
法令滋彰
盜賊多有

So the wise tell themselves,
We should provide nothing
and people will provide for themselves.
We should do nothing
and people will work it out for themselves.
We should just keep quiet
and people will straighten it out for themselves.
We should try to expect nothing
and people will figure it out for themselves.
故聖人云
我無為而民自化
我好靜而民自正
我無事而民自富
我無欲而民自樸
