Stop debating,
it's pointless.
Consent and concede,
how are they different?
Good and evil,
how are they the same?
Be it resolved that what some hold sacred
shouldn't demonize others.
絕學無憂
唯之與阿相去幾何
善之與惡相去若何
人之所畏不可不畏

They were so enthusiastic,
even before it started.
Everyone was excited,
like they were at the village fair
and they were raising the maypole.
I stayed out of it, not even a joke,
like a newborn, not even a smile.
荒兮其未央哉
衆人熙熙
如享太牢
如春登臺
我獨怕兮其未兆
如嬰兒之未孩

It was so depressing,
like I was the village idiot.
Everyone else got it
and I just got lost.
My poor brain,
I was so confused.
Their arguments were brilliant,
and I was just so dim.
Their arguments were incisive,
and I was just so dull.
It was so overwhelming,
like I was lost at sea.
It was so abstract,
like nothing was true.
儽儽兮若無所歸
衆人皆有餘而我獨若遺
我愚人之心也哉
沌沌兮俗人昭昭
我獨若昏
俗人察察
我獨悶悶
澹兮其若海
飂兮若無止

Everyone else had what it takes,
and I was just a small town hick.
We just wanted different things,
and I yearned for mother's milk.
衆人皆有以而我獨頑似鄙
我獨異於人而貴食母
