Good foundations don't crumble,
good bonds don't break,
families don't falter by following tradition.
善建不拔
善抱者不脫
子孫以祭祀不輟

Cultivate this within,
its character takes shape.
Nurture it in the family,
its character quickens.
Practice it in the community,
its character grows.
Promote it in the nation,
its character flourishes.
Inspire it in the world,
its character matures.
修之於身其德乃真
修之於家其德乃餘
修之於鄉其德乃長
修之於國其德乃豐
修之於天下其德乃普

I discover it within,
cherish it in families,
celebrate it in communities,
respect it in nations,
contemplate it in the world.
故以身觀身
以家觀家
以鄉觀鄉
以國觀國
以天下觀天下

So how do I know what people are like?
Like this.
吾何以知天下然哉
以此

# Notes

This and a few other poems
convince me that the _Dao De Jing_
is in some ways
deeply conservative.

Here it promotes
healthy, stable, lasting
habits and relationships
rooted in
personal character
and family values.

The first saying
presents vocabulary
to be applied in the second saying
and observed in the third.
It's virtues to cultivate,
and criteria for moral judgement.

The virtues
of healthy individuals and societies
are established,
unshakeable habits and traditions,
unbreakable relationships,
and an unflagging reverence
for those who came before.
