Dao never does anything.

If lords and kings could remember that,
everything would turn itself around,
turn around and want to help out.

We'd get it right
in the spontaneity of the wordless.

We'd also know
how to be satisfied with peace.

Everything would work itself out.

道常無為而無不為

侯王若能守之
萬物將自化

化而欲作
吾將鎮之以無名之樸

無名之樸
夫亦將無欲

不欲以靜
天下將自定
