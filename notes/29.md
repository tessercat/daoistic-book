Everybody wants to change the world.
I say it changes no matter what we do.
將欲取天下而為之
吾見其不得已

Legitimacy.
That's not something we can change.
Progressives are defeated by it,
conservatives lose it.
天下神器不可為也
為者敗之
執者失之

They're either too far ahead or too far behind,
too radical or too reactionary,
too cruel or too corrupt.
故物或行或隨
或歔或吹
或強或羸
或挫或隳

So the wise
reject too much,
too big,
too extreme.
是以聖人去甚
去奢
去泰
