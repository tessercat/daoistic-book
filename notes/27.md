Good explorers don't follow trails,
good communicators don't criticize,
good fortune-tellers don't use yarrow stalks.
A good defense doesn't bar the gate but can't be breached.
A good alliance doesn't sign a treaty but can't be broken.
善行無轍迹
善言無瑕讁
善數不用籌策
善閉無關楗而不可開
善結無繩約而不可解

So the wise are good at helping others,
and no one is expendable,
there's no wasted potential.
They call it passing the torch.
是以聖人常善救人故無棄人
常善救物故無棄物
是謂襲明

Since good people are good at being good people,
and bad people learn from good people,
not respecting the master,
not pitying the apprentice,
might seem smart,
but they're huge mistakes.
They say it's essential but subtle.
故善人者不善人之師
不善人者善人之資
不貴其師
不愛其資
雖智大迷
是謂要妙
