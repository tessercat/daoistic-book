The genius of the Dao De Jing

I've been reading the Dao De Jing
for about five years now,
and here are my thoughts.

It's...

A metaphysics of unity
that puts a word,
Dao,
on the mystical,
ineffable nothingness of all.

A physics of dualism
that explains everything that exists
as an interplay between complementary opposites,
as yin and yang mediated by qi,
and Dao
as the tendency
of systems to return
to a peaceful,
quiet,
neutral state,
a stone dropping in water.

A humanistic philosophy
that encourages us
to observe the universe deeply,
and to see it as moral,
and to apply its lessons in our lives.

A leadership manual
that counsels us to recognize
that people know what's best for themselves,
so leave them alone as much as possible,
that the best government is the least government,
that power corrupts
and actions have consequences,
and that the essential role
of wise leadership
is to mediate,
and not engage in,
conflict.

A gentle warning
that we're not in it only for ouselves,
that we're not somehow special or privileged,
that we should have character
and we shouldn't be lazy,
that we should listen closely and trust people,
be humble and keep it simple,
stay calm,
reserve judgement,
don't take offense.

A cautious optimism
that walking the middle way is
what it means to be enlightened
and what it takes to create anything that lasts,
that you can be selfless without losing yourself,
that a meaningful life isn't built
by looking after yourself,
but by being kind and helping others.
