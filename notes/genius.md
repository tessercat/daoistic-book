The genius of the Dao De Jing.

People seem to post their own 
Daoism-related thoughts and beliefs
on here pretty often,
so I thought I'd try.
I've been reading the Dao De Jing and Wenzi
pretty closely for about five years now,
and a conversation with u/lkjdf
prompted me to prove their point
by writing this
on how being a kind and decent person
flows naturally
from an apprehension
of the mystical unity
beyond self.

The genius of the Dao De Jing
is that it's...

A metaphysics of unity
that puts a word
on the mystical,
ineffable nothingness of it all.

A physics of dualism
that explains everything that exists
as an interplay between complementary opposites,
as yin and yang mediated by qi,
and Dao
as the tendency
of systems to return
to a peaceful,
quiet,
neutral state,
a stone dropping in water.

A humanistic philosophy
that encourages us
to observe the universe deeply,
to see it as moral,
and to apply its lessons in our lives.

A leadership manual
that counsels us
to recognize
that people know what's best for themselves
and that the best government is the least government.

That power corrupts and actions have consequences,
and that wise leadership
mediates conflict and doesn't engage in it,
gets out of the way and lets people get to work,
and nothing more.

A gentle warning
that we're not in it only for ourselves,
that we're not special or privileged,
that we should have character
and we shouldn't be lazy.

That we should listen closely and trust people,
be humble and keep it simple,
stay calm,
reserve judgement,
don't take offense.

A cautious optimism
that walking the middle way
is what it means to be enlightened
and what it takes to create anything that lasts.

That you can be selfless without losing yourself,
and that a long and healthy life isn't built
by looking out for number one,
but by being kind
and considering others.
