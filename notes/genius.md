The genius of the Dao De Jing

I've been reading the Dao De Jing
for about five years now,
and here are my thoughts.

It's...

A metaphysics
of unity
that puts a word,
Dao,
on the mystical,
ineffable nothingness of all,
that others might call Brahman,
or what I might call the God of Abraham
that appears as fire,
that must not be named,
that burns forever
and says only I am.

A physics of dualism
that explains everything that exists
as an interplay between opposites,
as yin and yang mediated by qi,
and Doa
as the tendency
of systems to return
to a peaceful,
quiet,
neutral state,
a stone dropping in water.

A humanistic philosophy
that encourages us
to observe the universe deeply,
and to see it as moral,
and to apply its lessons in our lives.

A leadership manual
that counsels us to recognize
that people know what's best for themselves,
and to leave them alone as much as possible,
that the best government is the least government,
that power corrupts,
that leaders should be cautious
and avoid unintended consequences,
and that the essential role
of wise leadership
is to mediate,
and not engage in,
conflict.

A gentle warning
that we're not in it only for ouselves,
that we're not somehow special or elite,
that we should have character
and we shouldn't be lazy,
that we should listen closely and trust people,
be normal and keep it simple,
stay calm and reserve judgement.

A calm reminder
that walking the middle way
is the proper way
to be a civilized,
decent human being.
