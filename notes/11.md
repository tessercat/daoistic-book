Thirty spokes share a hub.
Where it's empty,
that's the purpose of having a cart.
Work clay to make a pot.
Where it's empty,
that's the purpose of having a pot.
Door and window,
where it's empty,
that's the purpose of having a room.
三十輻共一轂
當其無有車之用
埏埴以為器
當其無有器之用
鑿戶牖以為室
當其無有室之用

So have it to take advantage,
lack it to have purpose.
故有之以為利
無之以為用
