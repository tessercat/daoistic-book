In an ideal world,
kingdoms rise,
rise and never fall.

Peace and prosperity,
parties and potstickers,
mission accomplished.

So the road speaks up,
says, So boring,
that's not interesting at all.

It's not worth looking at,
it's not worth listening to,
and can never come to be.

執大象
天下往
往而不害
安平大

樂與餌
過客止

道之出口
淡乎其無味
視之不足見
聽之不足聞
用之不足既
