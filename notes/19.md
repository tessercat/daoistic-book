Stop encouraging them,
don't motivate them,
people would do a hundred times more.
Stop cheating them,
don't exploit them,
crime wouldn't exist.
Stop forcing them,
don't threaten them,
people would cooperate.
絕聖棄智民利百倍
絕仁棄義民復孝慈
絕巧棄利盜賊無有

You might think these three sayings
aren't very efficient,
so order them to get in line.
Make it plain,
keep it simple,
be less needy,
don't be greedy.
此三者以為文不足
故令有所屬
見素抱樸
少私寡欲
