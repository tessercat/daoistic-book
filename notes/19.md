Stop encouraging them,
don't motivate them,
people would do a hundred times more.
Stop cheating them,
don't exploit them,
crime wouldn't exist.
Stop forcing them,
don't threaten them,
people would cooperate.
絕聖棄智民利百倍
絕仁棄義民復孝慈
絕巧棄利盜賊無有

You might think these three sayings
aren't very efficient,
so order them to get in line.
Make it plain,
keep it simple,
be less needy,
don't be greedy.
此三者以為文不足
故令有所屬
見素抱樸
少私寡欲

# Notes

This poem
has a lot of variation
between versions,
and the details
are anyone's guess,
but in general,
it's pretty clearly about
what good leaders don't do
when they're trying to get people
to work together on something,
and then,
some advice
on what to do instead.

The advice
contains the famous
characters for
raw silk and plain wood
as virtues to appreciate and protect,
and contrasts them
with self-interest and desire
as vices to minimize and reject.
