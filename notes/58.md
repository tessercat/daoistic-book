When reform is moderate, the people are willing,
when reform is sweeping, the system is broken.
其政悶悶
其民淳淳
其政察察
其民缺缺

Success depends on failure,
disaster hides in luck,
who knows what fate has in store?
禍兮福之所倚
福兮禍之所伏
孰知其極

When there's nothing to fix,
reform comes back as unintended consequences,
good intentions come back as problems.
To change people's minds,
keep calm and carry on.
其無正
正復為奇
善復為妖
人之迷
其日固久

so be consistent and don't give up,
be fair and don't provoke,
be firm but don't shackle,
light the way but don't shine.
是以聖人方而不割
廉而不劌
直而不肆
光而不燿
