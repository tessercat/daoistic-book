Making peace with the enemy,
hatred always lingers.
Patience is a virtue.
和大怨
必有餘怨
安可以為善

So the wise honour their obligations
and don't impose them on others.
是以聖人執左契
而不責於人

Character honours the deal,
and lack of character honours its due,
the universal way,
without caring,
is always with the virtuous.
有德司契
無德司徹
天道無親
常與善人
