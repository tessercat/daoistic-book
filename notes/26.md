Responsibility trumps taking it easy,
patience has authority over anger,
so in the everyday business of governing,
don't shrink from the burden of responsibility.
重為輕根
靜為躁君
是以聖人終日行不離輜重

When you have a solemn duty,
relaxing means keeping things in perspective.
How can you command ten-thousand chariots,
and be comfortable in public life?
Taking it easy means losing legitimacy,
getting angry means losing authority.
雖有榮觀
燕處超然
奈何萬乘之主而以身輕天下
輕則失本
躁則失君
