It divides and unites,
bends and straightens,
ebbs and flows,
destroys and rebuilds,
shrinks and grows,
spreads and splits apart.
曲則全
枉則直
窪則盈
弊則新
少則得
多則惑

So the wise are committed to
applying this in their lives.
是以聖人抱一為天下式

They don't explain it because it's clear,
don't prove it because it's obvious,
don't brag about it because it's worthwhile,
don't praise it because it's excellent,
and above all they don't argue
because no one can argue with it.
不自見故明
不自是故彰
不自伐故有功
不自矜故長
夫唯不爭故天下莫能與之爭

What the ancients said
about division and unity,
was it false doctrine?
They were true believers
but came back to it.
古之所謂曲則全者
豈虛言哉
誠全而歸之
