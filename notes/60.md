Running a big country
is like cooking little fish.
治大國若烹小鮮

When the world is on the right track,
the dead don't come back to haunt us.
Not only do the dead not haunt us,
the gods don't punish anyone.
Not only do gods not punish anyone,
the wise don't punish anyone either.
以道蒞天下其鬼不神
非其鬼不神其神不傷人
非其神不傷人聖人亦不傷人

When two sides stop punishing each other,
a moral relationship returns to them.
夫兩不相傷
故德交歸焉。
