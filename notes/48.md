Study every day and get better,
follow the way every day and get worse.
Get worse and worse
till you end up doing nothing,
doing nothing, but nothing's left undone.
為學日益
為道日損
損之又損
以至於無為
無為而無不為

Always get ahead in the world
by having no work to do.
When there's work to do,
getting ahead isn't important.
取天下常以無事
及其有事
不足以取天下
