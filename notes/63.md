Practice doing nothing,
try striving for nothing,
savour the taste of nothing.
為無為
事無事
味無味

Big or small,
many or few,
face conflict with character.
大小多少
報怨以德

Plan hard jobs as easy ones,
make big things from little ones.
Hardship comes from taking it easy,
greatness come from humility.
That's why the wise
never think big,
so they can do great things.
圖難於其易
為大於其細
天下難事
必作於易
天下大事
必作於細
是以聖人終不為大
故能成其大

An easy promise is an empty promise,
taking it too easy makes it a lot harder.
That's when the wise
are hard on them,
so nothing is ever difficult.
夫輕諾必寡信
多易必多難
是以聖人猶難之
故終無難矣
