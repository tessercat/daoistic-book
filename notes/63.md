Practice doing nothing,
try striving for nothing,
savour the taste of nothing.
為無為
事無事
味無味

Big or small,
many or few,
face conflict with character.
大小多少
報怨以德

Plan hard jobs as easy ones,
make big things from little ones.
Hardship comes from taking it easy,
greatness come from humility.
That's why the wise
never think big,
so they can do great things.
圖難於其易
為大於其細
天下難事
必作於易
天下大事
必作於細
是以聖人終不為大
故能成其大

An easy promise is an empty promise,
taking it too easy makes it a lot harder.
That's when the wise
are hard on them,
so nothing is ever difficult.
夫輕諾必寡信
多易必多難
是以聖人猶難之
故終無難矣

# Notes

This interpretation
is nothing like
the "accepted" version.
難 and 易
are usually translated
as something like
hard and easy,
and the poem is normally about
the importance of doing things
a little at a time. 

But 難 and 易
can also mean
conflict and exchange,
and since it's easier for me
to reconcile other features
of the poem with this
non-standard interpretation
of these two key characters,
my version is about
why conflict happens
and how to resolve it,
or better yet,
how to avoid it
in the first place.

Note that
since I've taken this poem
as a fairly extreme statement
of libertarian economics,
I've also taken the liberty of changing
味無味 to 知無知
to make a stronger statement
about the importance of the ruler
getting out of the way,
and Cook's Guodian footnotes
indicate that this change
isn't completely outside the realm of possibility.
He notes in particular that
[Wenzi 道原 4](https://ctext.org/wenzi/dao-yuan#n58493)
contains a variation
that ends with 知不知.
In for a penny,
in for a pound.

Cook's footnotes
also point out the considerable debate
regarding the interpretation of 大小 and 多少.
If you search ctext
for passages containing
[both terms](https://ctext.org/pre-qin-and-han?searchu=大小%20多少),
the discussion is about justice,
and if you search for
[報怨](https://ctext.org/pre-qin-and-han?searchu=報怨),
the debate is about how to respond to
the problem of criminal justice,
with 直 or 德.

[猶難](https://ctext.org/pre-qin-and-han?searchu=猶難),
also appears in ctext,
including twice in the Daodejing.
(See also
[chapter 77](https://daodejing.ca/studies/73 "Study chapter 77")).
According to Kroll,
both can mean something like blame,
and in context,
they look something like "punishment" to me,
or at least an ominous warning.
