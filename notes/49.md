Wise politicians never think for themselves.
They let citizens think for them.
They get along with saints
and they get along with sinners.
Character has respect.
They trust the believers
and they trust the skeptics.
Character has faith.
聖人無常心
以百姓心為心
善者吾善之
不善者吾亦善之
德善
信者吾信之
不信者吾亦信之
德信

The role of the wise
is to bring people together,
to get people to cooperate.
Citizens always want to know how they fit in.
The wise always make room for them.
聖人在天下
歙歙為天下渾其心
百姓皆注其耳目
聖人皆孩之
