Observe the mind, focus, allow no distractions.
Concentrate the breath, soften, allow innocence.
Practice letting go, deepen reflection, allow no criticism.
Love humanity, contemplate community, allow no prejudice.
Cosmic gates open and close, allow acceptance.
Aware of everything, allow no thought.
載營魄抱一能無離乎
專氣致柔能嬰兒乎
滌除玄覽能無疵乎
愛民治國能無知乎
天門開闔能為雌乎
明白四達能無知乎

It gives us life,
nurtures us,
creates but doesn't keep us,
leads but doesn't rule us.
They call it Xuande, deeply moral.
生之
畜之
生而不有
為而不恃
長而不宰
是謂玄德
