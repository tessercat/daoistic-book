Understanding it means not talking about it,
talking about it means not understanding it.
知者不言
言者不知

Close the shutters,
bar the gate,
dim the light,
stir the ash,
dull the edge,
loosen the knot.
塞其兑
閉其門
挫其銳
解其分
和其光
同其塵

They call it Xuantong, deep ambivalence,
是謂玄同

It's why you can't get it and care,
and you can't get it and forget,
you can't get it and get ahead,
and you can't get it and get hurt,
you can't get it and get respect
and you can't get it and hate
故不可得而親 不可得而踈
不可得而利 不可得而害
不可得而貴 不可得而賤

It's why we treat the world with respect.
故為天下貴
