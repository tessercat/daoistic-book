Stay on track by backing good leaders,
don't fight wars to get your way in the world.
以道佐人主者
不以兵強天下

Good ones get results and nothing more,
they don't get their way by force.
They get results but don't hurt anyone,
don't bully anyone,
don't threaten anyone.
They call it getting results
but not getting their way.
It's worth the effort.

其事好還

師之所處
荊棘生焉

大軍之後
必有凶年

善有果而已
不敢以取強

果而勿矜
果而勿伐
果而勿驕
果而不得已
果而勿強

物壯則老
是謂不道
不道早已
