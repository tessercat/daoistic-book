# Success

When good leaders hear about Dao,
it's hard, but they walk
right down the middle.
When average leaders hear about it,
some create, some destroy.
When poor leaders hear about it,
they laugh at it.
If it wasn't funny,
it wouldn't be Dao.
上士聞道勤而行之
中士聞道若存若亡
下士聞道大笑之
不笑不足以為道

That's what happens
when we tell them that
the right way seems wrong,
the easy way seems hard,
and the way forward might be a step back.
故建言有之
明道若昧
進道若退
夷道若纇

That the highly moral seem vain
and the deeply humble seem arrogant.
Liberal values seem worthless
and conservative values seem corrupt.
Absolute truth might be fickle.
上德若谷
太白若辱
廣德若不足
建德若偷
質真若渝

That time and space are infinite,
great potential develops slowly,
the good word is rarely heard,
the grand plan is never revealed.
大方無隅
大器晚成
大音希聲
大象無形

That Dao hides in the nameless,
and above all
that Dao is good
at both forgiving and reconciling.
道隱無名
夫唯道善貸且成
