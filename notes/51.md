Dao creates us but De tames us.
Nature forms us but nurture finishes us.
So everything reveres Dao but respects De.
道生之
德畜之
物形之
勢成之
是以萬物莫不尊道而貴德

Reverence of Dao,
respect of De,
no one orders it to be so,
but it's always like that.
道之尊
德之貴
夫莫之命常自然

Dao creates us, tames us,
leads us, educates us,
builds us up, tears us down,
supports us, lets us down.
故道生之
德畜之
長之育之
亭之毒之
養之覆之

It creates us, but doesn't own us.
Changes us, but doesn't tell us.
Leads us but doesn't rule us.
They say it's Xuande, deeply moral.
生而不有
為而不恃
長而不宰
是謂玄德
