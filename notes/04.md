Dao is an empty pot,
but using it
doesn't seem to fill it.
道沖而用之或不盈

As deep as the past,
it questions our faith,
answers our questions,
tempers our passion,
mixes our dust.
淵兮似萬物之宗
挫其銳
解其紛
和其光
同其塵

As wide as the future,
it's the child of who knows what,
parent of Xiangdi, saints of old.
湛兮似或存
吾不知誰之子
象帝之先
