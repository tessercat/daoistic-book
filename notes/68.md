Be civilized, don't be warlike.
Be a good warrior, don’t get angry.
Defeat your enemies, don't engage them.
Be a good commander, demote yourself.
善為士者不武
善戰者不怒
善勝敵者不與
善用人者為之下

It's about nonviolence,
it's about cooperation,
it's about partnering with the universe,
the ancient ideal.
是謂不爭之德
是謂用人之力
是謂配天古之極
