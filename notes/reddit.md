Hello Taoism,
I've been learning to read classical Chinese
so I could read along with the Dao De Jing on ctext.
I've been at it for about five years now,
and I've visited and re-visited chapter 4
quite a few times.

[Wangbi/Legge chapter 4](https://ctext.org/dao-de-jing#n11595)

It seems very obscure to me,
but I've been reading it again this morning,
and,
to put a handle on it,
when I take 沖 as an empty pot,
and 用之或 as putting something in
the emptiness that is Dao,
the set of four sayings
become things to put in the Dao
that won't fill it up.

So here's my interpretation:

    Dao is an empty pot
    but putting something in it
    doesn't fill it up.

    As deep as the past, it
    grinds up sharp blades,
    loosens tangled knots,
    dims bright lights,
    dissolves tiny specks.

    As wide as the future, it's the
    child of who knows what,
    the parent of Xiangdi, saints of old.

It's a riff on what Dao can do for you
and the pointless kinds of things
you should put in it
for empty Dao to consume
so you don't get overwhelmed by them.

With that context in mind,
my commentary on the four sayings would be
that when you put your anger or certainty in the Dao pot,
the pot doesn't justify or validate them, but undermines and doubts them instead.
When your anxieties go in there, they don't overwhelm it, it loosens them up instead.
When you put your high ideals in there, they're not vindicated, they get toned down instead.
When you put your petty concerns in there, they don't become real but dissolve instead.

Past vs future and child vs parent
aren't orthodox,
and neither are my grammar and word choices
for the four sayings,
but they're arguable, I think,
and read nicely as complements.

I'm not quite sure what to make of 象帝,
but neither is anyone else,
it seems.
There aren't many instances of it in ctext,
but it has something to do with
a shrine to ancient culture heroes,
so a proper name seemed appropriate.

Anyhow,
thought I'd share a few study notes.
