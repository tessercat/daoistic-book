In diplomacy, honour the treaty,
at war, honour the alliance.

They say soldiers
aren't very diplomatic.

When there's no option but to use them,
overwhelming force works best.

Don't glorify them.

Glorifying them
is really celebrating murder.

Taking pleasure in killing people
won't get you far in the world.

Since they say that festivals favour the east,
and funerals favour the west,
seat the conquered on the right,
seat the victor on the left.

Hold a service in remembrance,
mourn the dead in sadness and sorrow,
hold a wake for victory in war.

夫佳兵者不祥之器
物或惡之
故有道者不處

君子居則貴左
用兵則貴右

兵者不祥之器
非君子之器
不得已而用之
恬淡為上

勝而不美而美之者是樂殺人

夫樂殺人者則不可以得志於天下矣

吉事尚左
凶事尚右

偏將軍居左
上將軍居右
言以喪禮處之

殺人之衆以哀悲泣之
戰勝以喪禮處之
