It's best when they only know they have one.
It's less than ideal when they're devoted and admire you,
worse still when they respect you,
even worse when they're your friends.
太上下知有之
其次親而譽之
其次畏之
其次侮之

When you don't trust them enough,
expect mistrust,
and deprive yourself of their expertise.
信不足焉有不信焉
悠兮其貴言

Just do your job and do it well
so everyone says,
I'll do that too.
功成事遂
百姓皆謂我自然

Because a decadent society
expects kindness and decency,
an unhealthy family
expects obedience and commitment,
and a corrupt ruling class
expects loyalty and service.
大道廢有仁義
智慧出有大偽
六親不和有孝慈
國家昏亂有忠臣
