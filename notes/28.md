Mind the rooster, protect the hen,
build a chicken coop for the world.
A high quality coop isn't a cage,
it takes us back to innocence.
知其雄守其雌為天下谿
為天下谿常德不離
復歸於嬰兒

Mind the crop, protect it from weeds,
plant a garden for the world.
A high quality garden is just enough,
it takes us back to nature.
知其白守其黑為天下式
為天下式常德不忒
復歸於無極

Mind what's right, protect it from wrong,
set standards for the world.
High quality standards aren't strict,
they take us back to freedom.
知其榮守其辱為天下谷
為天下谷常德乃足
復歸於樸

When timber splits, improvise,
and when the wise approve, make it official,
In the grand scheme of things,
there are no mistakes.
樸散則為器
聖人用之則為官長
故大制不割
