Bright colors tire the eye,
strong flavours numb the mouth,
loud music deafens the ear.
五色令人目盲
五音令人耳聾
五味令人口爽

The autumn hunt drives people insane.
The finer things get in the way.
馳騁田獵令人心發狂
難得之貨令人行妨

So the government of the wise
serves the belly,
not the eye.
So let go of weariness,
hear this.
是以聖人為腹不為目
故去彼取此
