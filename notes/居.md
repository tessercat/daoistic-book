# Variation of 處 and 居 in ctext versions of the Dao De Jing

## Introduction

I compared snapshots of ctext's versions of
王弼,
河上公,
馬王堆乙,
馬王堆甲
and 郭店
from 2016.

- 河上公 usage is identical to 王弼.
  They are both referred to below as R.
- 處 is not used in 郭店, only 居.
  G below.
- 馬王堆甲 usage is identical to 馬王堆乙,
  but corrupted in 馬王堆甲 in 77,
  and 80 is missing entirely from 馬王堆甲.
  Both are M below.

處 in R: 2 8 24    26 30 31 38 66    76 77
居 in R: 2 8    25       31 38    72       80

居 in G: 2      25       31

居 in M: 2 8 24 25    30 31 38 66 72 76 77 80
處 in M:           26    31


## Meaning

In Kroll,
處 is defined as


## Usage by chapter

Unless otherwise mentioned,
assume no G version.


### 2

Appears three times in 2,
once to descibe the kind of business 事 the wise are in,
and twice in opposition to the anchor character 去
in the final statement.

R use 處 for the description of the wise,
MWD and G both use 居 in all three cases.

It troubles me that the sense in 2 is is negative,
don't do this so that,
where it's something to aspire to in 8.

### 8

In 8, R use 處 to describe water,
and M use 居.

In either case,
it describes what water does with 惡,
and it's the opposite of the anchor character, 尤.


### 24

Appears once in both R and M,
in both cases as the poem's anchor character.
R use 處 and M use 居.


### 25

Appears once in each of R, M and G,
in each case as 居,
and in each case part of the same phrase:
- 域中有四大，而王居其一焉 in R
- 國中有四大，而王居一焉 in M
- 域中有四大，而王居一焉 in G


### 26

Appears in both M and R only as 處,
in each case part of the same phrase:
- 雖有榮觀，燕處超然 in R
- 雖有環官，燕處則昭若 in M,
  though it's corrpted in 甲


### 30

Appears once in R as 處
and once in M as 居,
in both cases as part of the same phrase:
- 果而毌驕，果而勿矜，果□□傷，果而毌得已居 

The phrase is missing from G,
but otherwise more or less mirrors R and M.
