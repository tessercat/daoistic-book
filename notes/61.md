The strong give in and go with the flow,
the world's bitch.
In the world's love affairs,
the female always dominates the male by seducing him,
and to be seductive,
it helps to be submissive.
大國者下流
天下之交
天下之牝
牝常以靜勝牡
以靜為下

When the strong give in to the weak,
they dominate the weak.
When the weak give in to the strong,
they take from the strong.
So sometimes give in to dominate,
and sometimes give in but receive.
故大國以下小國則取小國
小國以下大國則取大國
故或下以取
或下而取

So the strong don't pass up an opportunity to unite and shepherd others,
and the weak don't pass up an opportunity to join and follow others.
For everyone to get what they want,
it helps when the strong are humble.
大國不過欲兼畜人
小國不過欲入事人
夫兩者各得其所欲
大者宜為下
