It's stable and easy to sustain,
predictable and easy to plan,
fragile and easily shattered,
skittish and easily scattered.
其安易持
其未兆易謀
其脆易泮
其微易散

Handle it before it happens,
fix it before it falls apart.
為之於未有
治之於未亂

A tree this big around
grew from a tiny sprout.
A tower nine stories high
rose from a pile of dirt.
A journey of a thousand miles
starts with a single step.
合抱之木生於毫末
九層之臺起於累土
千里之行始於足下

Running things ruins them,
holding on chases them away,
so the wise don't do anything
so they don't ruin anything,
and don't keep anything
so they don't lose anything.
為者敗之
執者失之
是以聖人無為故無敗
無執故無失


So the wise try not to want anything,
and they don't appreciate the finer things.

They learn not to conform
and they ignore what everyone else says
so they can affirm everything’s true nature
and they wouldn't dare tell us what to do. 

When there's work to do,
people often fail just as they're about to succeed,
民之從事
常於幾成而敗之
慎終如始則無敗事

so they tell us
to be as careful at the end
as we were at the beginning
so we don't waste effort.
是以聖人
欲不欲不貴難得之貨
學不學復衆人之所過
以輔萬物之自然而不敢為
