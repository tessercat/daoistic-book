Become completely empty,
stay perfectly still.
Everything that makes progress,
I watch it fall back.
Living creatures blossom and bloom,
every one of us turns back to dust.
致虛極
守靜篤
萬物並作
吾以觀復
夫物芸芸
各復歸其根

So says stillness.
Stillness, they call it a progress report.
Progress reports are factual,
facing facts is enlightenment.
Denying facts is delusion,
delusion is dangerous.
歸根曰靜
是謂復命
復命曰常
知常曰明
不知常
妄作凶
知常容

Patiently facing facts,
patience leads to tolerance,
tolerance leads to balance,
balance leads to harmony,
harmony leads to the way,
the way leads to selfless integrity.
容乃公
公乃王
王乃天
天乃道
道乃久
沒身不殆
