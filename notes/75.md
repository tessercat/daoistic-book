Peasants starve when taxes are too high. That's why they're starving.
Workers get upset when the boss gets involved. That's why they're disorganized.
People risk death when they want life to reward them. That's why they're willing to die.
民之飢以其上食稅之多是以飢
民之難治以其上之有為是以難治
民之輕死以其求生之厚是以輕死

Only those who expect nothing of life
are truly capable of appreciating life.
夫唯無以生為者
是賢於貴生
