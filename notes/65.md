Since they say follow the way
not by enlightening people,
but by keeping them in the dark,
people are hard to govern when they're aware.
古之善為道者
非以明民
將以愚之
民之難治以其智多

Because when they notice government, they're against it,
when they don't notice government, they're for it.
故以智治國
國之賊
不以智治國
國之福

Those who always keep this in mind just have to follow the signs.
Always knowing how to follow signs means Xuande, deep morality.
知此兩者亦𥡴式
常知𥡴式
是謂玄德

When deep morality is ingrained,
pervasive,
lets others disagree,
there's perfect harmony.
玄德深矣
遠矣
與物反矣
然後乃至大順
