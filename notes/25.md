There was something uniform and perfect
before the creation of heaven and earth.
In silent stillness,
in unchanging solitude,
think of it as society's mother.
有物混成
先天地生
寂兮寥兮
獨立不改
周行而不殆
可以為天下母

No one knows how to describe it.
I call it Dao.
If you ask me to describe it,
I'll call it great.
Greatness, I call that mortality.
Mortality, I call that separation.
Separation, I call that revolution.
吾不知其名
字之曰道
強為之名曰大
大曰逝
逝曰遠
遠曰反

The heavens are great,
the earth is great,
Dao is great,
and kings are great too.
The greatness of the middle realm is four-fold,
and kings are part of but one.
Humanity is to the earth,
as the earth is to the universe,
as the the universe is to Dao,
as Dao is to what is.
故道大
天大
地大
王亦大
域中有四大而王居其一焉
人法地
地法天
天法道
道法自然
