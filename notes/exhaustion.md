Other bosses judge for themselves and think other people are stupid.
They do it themselves and think other people are incompetent.
When they're like that, the stupid and incompetent have questions,
and the skilled and clever decide.
人主自智而愚人
自巧而拙人
若此則愚拙者請矣
巧智者詔矣

When they have a lot of decisions to make, they get even more questions,
and those questions become even more questions,
and eventually, there's nothing they don't decide.
詔多則請者愈多矣
請者愈多
且無不請也

主雖巧智
未無不知也
以未無不知
應無不請
其道固窮
Even when bosses are skilled and clever,
they're not without ignorance.
And since they're not without ignorance
they're also not without questions,
and they're well on the way to exhaustion.

為人主而數窮於其下
將何以君人乎
If you're the other boss and you blame your exhaustion on subordinates,
how does that make you a good leader?

窮而不知其窮
其患又將反以自多
是之謂重塞之主
無存國矣
When you're exhausted and you don't know you're exhausted,
you ...
They call you the boss of heavy something
and you're not good for the company.

That's why the boss of having principles
manages but doesn't act
reals and doesn't decide
lets go of something, lets go of another thing,
hm
doesn't something their words
doesn't something else their work
hm
bureaucrats take responsibility
in ignorance makes his way
hm
故有道之主
因而不為
責而不詔
去想去意
靜虛以待
不伐之言
不奪之事
督名審實
官使自司
以不知為道
以柰何為實

Didn't he say, do what the sun and moon's what is destined
Didn't someone else say, manage four quarters' outside
Didn't the next say, govern something north, reform nine yangs, hm

舜曰「若何而服四荒之外」？
禹曰「若何而治青北、化九陽、奇怪之所際」？
