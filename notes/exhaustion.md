Other bosses judge for themselves and think other people are stupid.
They do everything themselves and think other people are incompetent.
When it's like that, the stupid and incompetent have questions,
and the skilled and clever have all the answers.
人主自智而愚人
自巧而拙人
若此則愚拙者請矣
巧智者詔矣

When they make all the decisions, they get even more questions,
and those questions become even more questions,
and eventually, there's nothing they don't decide.
詔多則請者愈多矣
請者愈多
且無不請也

Even when bosses are skilled and clever,
they're not without ignorance.
And since they're not without ignorance
they're obviously not without questions,
and they're well on their way to exhaustion.
主雖巧智
未無不知也
以未無不知
應無不請
其道固窮

If you're the other boss and you blame your exhaustion on subordinates,
how does that make you a good leader?
為人主而數窮於其下
將何以君人乎

When you're tired and you don't know you're tired,
problems come back as bigger problems.
They call you the boss of dead ends,
and you're no good to the company.
窮而不知其窮
其患又將反以自多
是之謂重塞之主
無存國矣

That's why the boss of the way forward
sets the agenda but doesn't implement it,
assigns responsibilities, but doesn't answer questions.
They reject theory, reject opinion,
they're still and empty, and they wait.
They don't criticize suggestions,
and they don't interfere.
They weigh their words and investigate the facts,
and order the government to run itself.
They lead the way in ignorance,
but they use the facts to guide them.
故有道之主
因而不為
責而不詔
去想去意
靜虛以待
不伐之言
不奪之事
督名審實
官使自司
以不知為道
以柰何為實

Didn't Yao tell us to do as the sun and moon command?
Didn't Shun tell us to respect the borders of four deserts?
Didn't Yu tell us to rule within the northern green,
and to make progress within the limits of nine yang magic.
堯曰若何而為及日月之所燭
舜曰若何而服四荒之外
禹曰若何而治青北
化九陽奇怪之所際
