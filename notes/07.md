The universe is vast, the earth is ancient.
How did heaven and earth get so big and old?
Not living for themselves
lets them live so long.
天長地久
天地所以能長且久者
以其不自生
故能長生

So the wise put themselves last but lead,
look beyond themselves but endure.
Shouldn't we be unselfish
since that's what lets us become ourselves?
是以聖人後其身而身先
外其身而身存
非以其無私耶
故能成其私。
