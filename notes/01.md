Ideas can be expressed, but it's not a normal idea.
Words can be defined, but it's not a normal word.
道可道非常道
名可名非常名

Nameless, it's the author of heaven and earth,
named, it explains everything.
無名天地之始
有名萬物之母

So be objective to observe its subtleties,
be subjective to discover how to describe it.
故常無欲以觀其妙
常有欲以觀其徼

These couplets complement
but contradict each other.
Together, call them Xuan, a proposition.
Thesis and hypothesis,
a process of infinite subtlety.
此兩者同出而異名
同謂之玄
玄之又玄
衆妙之門

# Notes

On the subtle process
of describing the indescribable.

The _Dao De Jing_ uses 謂
(often as 是謂,
"this is called"
or "defined as")
to name certain important concepts,
as it does here for 玄.

This poem is the only one
that defines 玄 alone,
not as part of a binomial.

Other named 玄 binomials
are in 6 (玄牝),
in 10, 51 and 65 (玄德),
and in 56 (玄同).
