Don't ask me to explain
how to do the right thing
because I'm afraid of what I might say.
使我介然有知
行於大道
唯施是畏

The high road is easy,
but people like shortcuts.
大道甚夷而民好徑

You've shut down government,
fields are fallow,
granaries are empty.
朝甚除
田甚蕪
倉甚虛

You wear silk robes
and carry a sharp sword.
You stuff your face
and line your pockets,
and still want more.
That makes you a tyrant.
Definitely a dead end.
服文綵
帶利劍
厭飲食
財貨有餘
是謂盜夸
非道也哉
