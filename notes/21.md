Apostles of the open heart
are devoted only to the road.
Others on the road,
only to faith,
only to doubt.
孔德之容唯道是從
道之為物唯恍唯惚

Between doubt and faith, there's reason.
Between faith and doubt, there's reality.
Between staying quiet and speaking up, there's a calling.
Within a truly worthy calling, there's commitment.
忽兮恍兮其中有象
恍兮忽兮其中有物
窈兮冥兮其中有精
其精甚真其中有信

Till now from days of old,
our movement hasn't faltered
by remembering founding fathers.
自古及今其名不去
以閱衆甫

How do I know
what the founding father were like?
Like this.
吾何以知衆甫之狀哉
以此
