When people are either obedient
or don't fear death,
why execute and terrorize them?
民不畏死
奈何以死懼之

When people are told either to obey
or to face death
and they do something wrong,
when you give the order to arrest and execute them,
who would dare?
若使民常畏死而為奇者
吾得執而殺之
孰敢

When people must either obey
or face certain death,
appoint an executioner
and execute anyone who interferes.
常有司殺者殺
夫司殺者

In reality, they're interfering with
the master carpenter's blade,
and anyone who gets in the way of
the master carpenter's blade
rarely doesn't cut their hands.
是大匠斲
夫代大匠斲者
希有不傷其手矣
