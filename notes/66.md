They say rivers and seas
rule a hundred valleys.
Letting themselves be low
lets them be king.
江海所以能為百谷王者
以其善下之
故能為百谷王

The wise lead others
by reporting to them in person.
They have authority over others
by submitting to their command.
是以聖人欲上民
必以言下之
欲先民
必以身後之

Their authority doesn't oppress anyone.
Their leadership doesn't hurt anyone.
The world is happy to oblige and doesn't resent them.
是以聖人處上而民不重
處前而民不害
是以天下樂推而不厭

By not competing,
they're beyond compare.
以其不爭
故天下莫能與之爭
