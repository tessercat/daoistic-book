Everything follows to the road.
Honest people treasure it.
Dishonest people take refuge in it.
道者萬物之奧
善人之寶
不善人之所保

Pretty words might be flattery,
good deeds might be favours.
The lies people tell,
who can deny they exist?
美言可以市
尊行可以加人
人之不善
何棄之有

That's why the throne of the Child of Heaven,
or being anointed as one of the Three Lords,
or just serving as Jade of Honour by leading the Four Mares,
isn't as important as sitting and contemplating this.
故立天子
置三公
雖有拱璧以先駟馬
不如坐進此道

But why did the ancients want those things?
Didn't they say,
Ask and ye shall receive,
sin and ye shall be forgiven?
古之所以貴此道者何
不曰
以求得
有罪以免耶

That's what made the world want them.
故為天下貴
