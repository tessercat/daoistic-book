The truly powerful are like newborn babes.
Scorpions don't sting them.
Predators don't snatch them.
含德之厚比於赤子
蜂蠆虺蛇不螫
猛獸不據
攫鳥不搏

Delicate bones, soft muscles, but a firm grip.
Ignorant of the facts of life, but shrinking and growing in perfect innocence.
Singing all day, but not straining, in perfect harmony.
骨弱筋柔而握固
未知牝牡之合而全作精之至也
終日號而不嗄和之至也

Harmony, that's persistence.
Noticing harmony, that's enlightenment.
Promoting life, that's grace.
A beating heart, that's power.
知和曰常
知常曰明
益生曰祥
心使氣曰強

When we grow up, we get old,
and they say we're out of touch.
Out of touch and out of time.
物壯則老
謂之不道
不道早已。
