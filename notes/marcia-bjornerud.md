Hi Marcia,

I hope it's all right for me to contact you at your work email.

I've been teaching myself to read classical Chinese
so I can read and interpret the _Dao De Jing_ for myself,
and I've been thinking about _Reading the Rocks_ quite a lot lately
as I interpret a passage from _Wenzi_ on Daoist cosmology.

I'm not an expert in Daoism or classical Chinese,
just an old software developer with a blog,
but I think I've channeled the gist of the passage
as accurately and readably as I can.
I hope you find it
a worthy expression of gratitude
for _Reading the Rocks_.
