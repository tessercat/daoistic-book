Hi Marcia,

I hope it's all right for me to contact you at your work address for this.

I've been teaching myself to read classical Chinese
so I can read and interpret the _Dao De Jing_
in something like the original,
and I've been thinking a lot about _Reading the Rocks_ lately
as I interpret a passage from _Wenzi_ on Daoist cosmology.

I'm not sure that I fully understand the passage,
and the moralizing is a big much,
but I was fascinated by its description of the physics of sky, earth and life,
and it brought _Reading the Rocks_ to mind,
so I thought you might enjoy it as well.
