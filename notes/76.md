A newborn babe, soft and weak,
is stiff and stubborn in the end.
人之生也
柔弱其死也
堅強

Every new life, soft and tender,
withers and rots in the end.
萬物草木之生也
柔脆其死也
枯槁

Since hard and strong describe death
and soft and weak describe life,
故堅強者死之徒
柔弱者生之徒

strong armies don't win,
hard timber splits.
是以兵強則不勝
木強則共

Size and strength are liabilities,
the small and weak have the upper hand.
強大處下
柔弱處上
