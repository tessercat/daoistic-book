An interpretation of the ctext Guodian version of chapter 19 of the Dao De Jing.

Word, subject and grammar choices are informed by
the Kroll dictionary,
Cook's translation and footnotes,
my interpretation of the context,
and an attempt to produce readable English.
In my reading,
the Dao De Jing is a moral literacy manual for civil servants,
and in this one,
the sayings and the exposition are advice
from an old hand
to a 士 who's having trouble keeping a crew on task.
欲 is definitely not privilege,
but I don't think "check your privilege"
is too far from 寡欲,
and I like how it reads in 2019,
so there it is.

> Stop trying to educate them
> and refuse to lecture them,
> people are a hundred times better off.

> Stop trying to bullshit them
> and refuse to take advantage of them,
> you won't rob or hurt anyone.

> Stop trying to force them
> and refuse to threaten them,
> people start helping again.

> You might think these three sayings
> aren't very good advice,
> but when you let people take responsibility,
> they know what matters
> and keep it simple,
> swallow their pride
> and check their privilege.
