Everyone thinks that beauty is what makes us beautiful,
but it's our flaws.
We all think we're right
when we're wrong.
天下皆知美之為美斯惡已
皆知善之為善斯不善已

Something and nothing create each other,
hard and easy become each other.
Long and short measure each other,
high and low average each other.
Cause and effect balance each other,
before and after follow each other.
故有無相生
難易相成
長短相較
高下相傾
音聲相和
前後相隨

So the wise are in the business of doing nothing,
take orders from silence.
是以聖人處無為之事
行不言之教

They organize things but don't control them,
manage but don't force them,
build but don't stay there.
萬物作焉而不辭
生而不有
為而不恃
功成而弗居

Above all they don't stay there
so they don't get left behind.
夫唯弗居
是以不去。
