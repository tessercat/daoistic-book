The winding way
might go left or right.
Getting it done, following orders,
but not getting credit for it.

If everyone would have faith in it
and not try to act important,
they'd want for nothing,
and might get credit for something small.

Everyone who has faith in it
and doesn't try to act important
might even get asked to do something great.

So the ability of the wise to become great
depends on not acting great.

It's what lets them do great things.

大道汎兮
其可左右

萬物恃之而生而不辭
功成不名有

衣養萬物而不為主
常無欲
可名於小

萬物歸焉而不為主
可名為大

以其終不自為大
故能成其大
