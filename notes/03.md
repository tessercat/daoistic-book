People who aren't ambitious
don't fight.
People who don't appreciate the finer things
don't become thieves.
People who don't have dreams
don't make trouble.
不尚賢使民不爭
不貴難得之貨使民不為盜
不見可欲使心不亂

So the government of the wise
empties their minds,
settles their bellies,
weakens their will,
strengthens their bone.
Then people
don't suspect anything,
don't expect anything.
Then leaders
know not to interfere,
not to allow it,
and nothing more.
是以聖人之治
虛其心
實其腹
弱其志
強其骨
常使民無知無欲
使夫知者不敢為也

Then we don't mess anything up.
為無為則無不治

# Notes

I take this poem
as a statement of
extreme libertarianism.
The government of the wise
isn't a meritocracy,
it doesn't make people rich,
and it doesn't make promises.
It leaves people alone
and it doesn't do anything
so it doesn't screw anything up.
The positive influence of government
fills bellies and strengthens bones
and that's it.

My version
diverges from Wangbi near the end,
and I follow Mawangdui B instead.
There's not much difference in substance,
but I think it works better in English.
