Looking for it but not finding it,
they say it's obscure.
Listening for it but not not hearing it,
they say it's imminent.
Reaching for it but not getting it,
they say it's elusive.
視之不見名曰夷
聽之不聞名曰希
搏之不得名曰微

These three, they're inconclusive,
so mix them together as one.
此三者不可致詰
故混而為一

That one, promoting it doesn't prove it
and rejecting it doesn't refute it.
So vast it's immeasurable,
dwindling to nothing at all,
they call that a description of the indescribable.
其上不皦
其下不昧
繩繩不可名
復歸於無物
是謂無狀之狀

Thinking about nothing at all,
they call that refusing to believe.
無物之象
是謂惚恍

Welcome it without seeing its face,
follow along without seeing its back.
Stay on today's road
by navigating today's reality
by learning the lessons of the past.
They call that Daoji, rules of the road.
迎之不見其首
隨之不見其後
執古之道
以御今之有
能知古始
是謂道紀
