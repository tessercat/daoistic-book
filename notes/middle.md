I first heard of the _Dao De Jing_
in high school
when I noticed a flyer for
an _I Ching_ workshop
in a new age bookstore
and decided to check it out.
The workshop was led by
a professor of religious studies,
and I ended up taking his Daoism half-classes
a few years later.
We read and discussed
Lau's _Tao Te Ching_
and Watson's _Chuang Tzu_
as philosophy
in historical context,
so even though I liked to look around
new age bookstores as a kid,
the _Dao De Jing_ isn't a magical mystery tour for me,
it's a moral literacy manual
for public servants,
a sort of gentleman's manifesto
on how to live with integrity
by walking the middle way,
and,
as a consequence,
how to lead well.

In my interpretation,
the philosophy of leadership
presented in the _Dao De Jing_,
while rooted in mysticism,
is rational and practical,
and I see many parallels between
the ideas presented here
and ideas that today
might be called conservative.
It counsels leaders to recognize
that people know what's best for themselves,
so leave them alone as much as possible,
that the best government is the least government,
that power corrupts,
that leaders should be cautious
and avoid unintended consequences,
and that the essential role
of wise leadership
is to mediate,
and not engage in,
conflict.
It reminds them
that they're not in it for themselves,
that they're not somehow special or elite,
that they should have character
and keep ego in check,
listen closely
and trust people,
be normal
and keep it simple,
stay calm
and reserve judgement.

If there's any magic to be found
in the _Dao De Jing_,
it's that its humanisitic philosophy
is based on
a metaphysics of unity
and a physics of duality
that invites us to see the universe as moral,
and to entertain the notion
that it's possible to live morally
by taking its lessons to heart.
The only enlightenment
or immortality
on offer is the advice
that walking the middle way
is how to grow and last.
