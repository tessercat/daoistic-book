Filling it to the brim
isn't better than stopping.
Its polish and shine
can't last.
In a tomb full of gold and jewels,
who'll raise it then?
It's the pride of wealth and privilege,
keeping it is a mistake.
持而盈之不如其已
揣而銳之不可長保
金玉滿堂莫之能守
富貴而驕自遺其咎

Step up and step back,
the universal way.
功遂身退天之道

# Notes

I like this
as a toast,
the pouring and raising
a fancy goblet
in a pledge made to others
to pass on power responsibly
when assuming public office.
