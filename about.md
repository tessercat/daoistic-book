### About Daoistic

This is what happens
when software developers
with history degrees
and time on their hands
start wondering
what the source code looks like.
It turns out that classical Chinese
isn't exactly a programming language,
but semantics and syntax
are pretty well known,
and it's all online
and easily searchable
at [ctext](https://ctext.org).
Not that I'm an expert,
or even literate.
I can't write characters,
and I certainly can't read them out loud.
And I'll never be Daoist,
or Chinese,
or live 2500 years ago.
But the more I read,
the more I appreciate the point of view,
and the more I enjoy
trying to express it
in my own language.
While it's probably foolhardy
to attempt to express the inexpressible
in any language,
I can't seem to help it,
and when I'm objective about being subjective,
sometimes I think I get it right.

### References

Fuller and Rouzer were my Kernighan and Ritchie,
and I take Kroll very seriously.
I look at other translations
as a sanity check,
mostly Lau and Cook's Guodian notes.
The [Chinese Text Project](https://ctext.org)
is indispensable
for studying characters
and patterns of characters
in other contexts.

The hanzi poems are derived from
side-by-side comparison
of Guodian,
Heshanggong,
Mawangdui
and Wangbi
texts
copied from ctext
in 2016.
My versions are based on Wangbi,
but sometimes heavily modified
where a Guodian version exists.
I also like to include particles
that are missing in Wangbi
but present in other versions.

Unicode data for the

### Blog

As I study and interpret the _Dao De Jing_,
I often read passages from ctext
that share the same vocabulary as the _Dao De Jing_,
particularly the _Huainanzi_
and the closely related _Wenzi_.
The _Wenzi_ in particular seems
very much like literature to me,
so I've started to take a crack at interpreting a few
interesting passages
in the hope that I can do them justice.
My attempts can be found in
[the blog](/blog "Blogging the unbloggable").
