### About Daoistic

I took a few classes
in Daoism and Chinese history
way back when,
and I've looked at
a few different translations
of the _Dao De Jing_.
I've always been struck
by how different
they can be,
so a software developer
with a history degree
started wondering
what the source code looked like.
It turns out that
even though classical Chinese
isn't exactly a programming language,
it's a learnable technical skill,
so I've been learning it,
and staring at poems,
and building techy crutches,
and letting it change me,
and this site is what has become of it.
I think of it as
an ongoing personal art project.

Something I've noticed about
English translations I've looked at
is that chapters sometimes seem more like 
collections of pithy saying
than poems that hang together as a whole.
But the more I look a them
in something like the original,
the more surprising connections appear
that weren't there for me
in English.
Close reading
makes the poems look
more like jazz,
a master riffing
point and counterpoint
on a theme,
practical lessons on
what the universe is like,
how to live in it,
and how to lead.
So my interpretation
is an attempt
to make those connections as clear as possible
in English that's as readable
as I can make it
in the hope that
some of the jazz,
and maybe a lesson or two,
comes through.

Fuller and Rouzer were my Kernighan and Ritchie,

to the Kroll dictionary.
I look at other translations
as a sanity check,
mostly Lau and Cook,
and the [Chinese Text Project](https://ctext.org)
is indispensable
for studying characters
and patterns of characters
in other contexts.

### Blog

As I study and interpret the _Dao De Jing_,
I often read passages from ctext
that share the same vocabulary as the _Dao De Jing_,
particularly the _Huainanzi_
and the closely related _Wenzi_.
The _Wenzi_ in particular seems
very much like literature to me,
so I've started to take a crack at interpreting a few
interesting passages
in the hope that I can do them justice.
