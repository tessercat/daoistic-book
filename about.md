### About Daoistic

This is what happens
when a software developer
with a history degree
and time on his hands
start wondering
what the source code looks like.
It turns out that classical Chinese
isn't exactly a programming language,
but semantics and syntax
are pretty well known,
and it's all online
and easily searchable
on [ctext](https://ctext.org "Chinese Text Project").
Not that I'm an expert,
or even literate.
I can't write characters,
and I certainly can't read them out loud.
And I'll never be Daoist,
or Chinese,
or live 2500 years ago,
but the more I read,
the more I appreciate the point of view,
and the more I enjoy
trying to express it
in my own language.
While it's probably foolhardy
to attempt to express the inexpressible
in any language,
I can't seem to help it,
and when I'm objective about being subjective,
sometimes I think I get it right.

### References

Fuller and Rouzer were my Kernighan and Ritchie,
and I take Kroll very seriously.
I look at other translations
as a sanity check,
mostly Lau and Cook's Guodian notes.
The [Chinese Text Project](https://ctext.org "ctext")
is indispensable
for studying characters
and patterns of characters
in other contexts.

The hanzi poems are derived from
side-by-side comparison
of Guodian,
Heshanggong,
Mawangdui
and Wangbi
texts
copied from ctext
in 2016.
My versions are based on Wangbi,
but sometimes heavily modified
where a Guodian version exists.
I also like to include particles
that are missing in Wangbi
but present in other versions.

Unicode data for the
[reference tools](https://daoistic.ca/unihan/dump "Unihan reference tools")
is derived from the
[Unicode Han Database](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr38/ "tr38") (Unihan).

### Blog

As I study and interpret the _Dao De Jing_,
I often read passages from ctext
that share the same vocabulary as the _Dao De Jing_,
particularly the _Huainanzi_
and the closely related _Wenzi_.
The _Wenzi_ in particular seems
very much like literature to me,
so I've started to take a crack at interpreting a few
interesting passages
in the hope that I can do them justice.
My attempts can be found in
[the blog](/blog "Blogging the unbloggable").
