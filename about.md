### About Daoistic

I read the _Dao De Jing_
for a religious studies class
way back when,
but I had no idea
what to make of it.
I found the
[ctext](https://ctext.org/dao-de-jing "Dao De Jing - The Chinese Text Project")
version online
a few years ago,
and I liked how patterned the poems look
in classical Chinese
compared to how vague they seem in English,
so I thought I'd try
learning to read them
in classical Chinese.

A few years later,
I'm no expert,
definitely not Daoist,
still not Chinese,
but I love how jazzy and pithy
the poems are in Chinese,
and I like spending time
with
[Kroll's dictionary](https://brill.com/view/title/20918 "A Student's Dictionary of Classical and Medieval Chinese"),
wondering what
the old guy
was on about
and trying to express
what I think I find there
in my own language.

Though I'm not sure of much,
I can say by now
with some certainty
that *dao* in classical Chinese
is something like *principle* in English,
and *de* is something like *morality*,
so the _Dao De Jing_ is something like
_The Classic of Moral Principles_.

It's a handbook of moral philosophy
for public servants,
riffing point and counterpoint
on how to keep your balance
and be a good person,
maybe even do some lasting good,
in an uncertain and turbulent world.

### References

The studies
are derived from
side-by-side comparison
of Guodian,
Heshanggong,
Mawangdui
and Wangbi
texts copied from the
[Chinese Text Project](https://ctext.org "ctext")
in 2016.

Though the studies
are based on Wangbi,
some are heavily modified
where a Guodian version exists,
and I transcribe particles
from other versions to my own
when they help make sense
of Wangbi.
