### About Daoistic

This is what happens
when a software developer
with time on his hands
thinks he can
learn to read
the _Dao De Jing_
in classical Chinese.

### References

The studies
are derived from
side-by-side comparison
of Guodian,
Heshanggong,
Mawangdui
and Wangbi
texts copied from the
[Chinese Text Project](https://ctext.org "ctext")
in 2016.

Though the studies
are based on Wangbi,
some are heavily modified
where a Guodian version exists,
and I also transcribe particles
from other versions to my own
when they help make sense
of Wangbi.

Unicode data for the

[Unicode Han Database](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr38/ "tr38") (Unihan).
