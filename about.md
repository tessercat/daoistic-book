### About Daoistic

I took a few classes
in Daoism and Chinese history
way back when,
and I've looked at
a few different translations
of the _Dao De Jing_.
I've always been struck
by how different
they can be,
so a software developer
with a history degree
started wondering
what the source code looked like.
It turns out that
even though classical Chinese
isn't exactly a programming language,
it's a learnable technical skill,
so I've been learning it,
and staring at poems,
and building techy crutches,
and this site is what has become of it.
I think of it as
an ongoing personal art project.

### References

Fuller and Rouzer were my Kernighan and Ritchie,
and I try to stay true
to the Kroll dictionary.
I look at other translations
as a sanity check,
mostly Lau and Cook,
and the [Chinese Text Project](https://ctext.org)
is indispensable
for studying characters
and patterns of characters
in other contexts.
The hanzi poems are derived from
side-by-side comparison
of Guodian,
Heshanggong,
Mawangdui
and Wangbi
texts
copied from ctext
in 2016.

### Blog

As I study and interpret the _Dao De Jing_,
I often read passages from ctext
that share the same vocabulary as the _Dao De Jing_,
particularly the _Huainanzi_
and the closely related _Wenzi_.
The _Wenzi_ in particular seems
very much like literature to me,
so I've started to take a crack at interpreting a few
interesting passages
in the hope that I can do them justice.
My attempts can be found in
[the blog](/blog "Blogging the unbloggable").
