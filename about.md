# About Daoistic

I read the _Dao De Jing_
for a religious studies class
way back when,
but I had no idea
what to make of it.
I found the
[ctext version](https://ctext.org/dao-de-jing "ctext link")
online a few years ago,
and I liked how patterned the poems look
in classical Chinese
compared to how vague they seem in English,
so I thought I'd try
learning to read them
in something like their original.

A few years later,
I'm no expert,
definitely not Daoist,
still not Chinese,
but I love how
jazzy and pithy they are,
and I like spending time with
[Kroll's dictionary](https://brill.com/view/title/20918 "A Student's Dictionary of Classical and Medieval Chinese"),
wondering what they were on about
and trying to express
what I think I find there
in my own words.
