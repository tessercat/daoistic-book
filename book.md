無名
天地之始也，

## English

It's a way you can go.

It's not the usual way.

It's a word you can say.

It's not a normal word.

Nameless,
it's the conception of heaven and earth.

Named,
it's the mother of everything.

So never expect anything,
discover her secrets.

Always expecting something,
discover her sorrow.

Dualities emerge together,
opposites have meaning together.

Depth upon depth,
the teaching of Zhongmiao, hidden crew.

## English

When the whole world knows
what's good about being good,
there's already evil.

When everyone knows
what's right,
it's already gone wrong.

Since

something and nothing create each other,
and hard and easy become each other,
and long and short measure each other,
and top and bottom rely on each other,
and playing and hearing tune each other,
and first and last follow each other,

the wise stay busy doing nothing,
follow the instructions of silence.

Everything helps out,
but they don't organize it.

Everything behaves,
but they don't tell it what to do.

Everything works out,
but they don't stay there.

Above all they don't stay there
so they don't get left behind.

## English

People who aren't ambitious
don't fight.

People who don't appreciate the finer things
don't become thieves.

People who don't have dreams
don't make trouble.

So the government of the wise
empties the mind,
settles the belly,
weakens the will,
strengthens the bone.

Makes sure people
don't suspect anything,
don't expect anything.

Makes sure leaders
know not to interfere,
not to allow it,
and nothing more.

Then it doesn't mess anything up.

Dao is an empty pot
but putting something in it

As deep as the past, it
grinds up sharp blades,

The universe is vast, the earth is ancient.

The reason that heaven and earth
could grow and last
is that they don't live for themselves.

look beyond themselves but endure.

## English

A blessing is as bad as blame,
good is as selfish as evil.

What were they saying
about favour and disgrace?

Privilege is a put down.

When getting it was trouble
or losing it was trouble,
they were right to say
that blessings and blame are trouble.

Why did they say
that good is as selfish as evil?

We're evil when
we're selfish.

When we're selfless,
who gets hurt?

Since goodness disciplines people
as they rule the world,
the world can trust them,

and since compassion changes people
as they change the world,
the world should encourage it.

Looking for it but not finding it,

Listening for it but not not hearing it,
they say it's imminent.

Reaching for it but not getting it,
they say it's elusive.

These three, they're inconclusive,
so merge and become one.

That one, promoting it doesn't prove it,
rejecting it doesn't refute it.

So vast it's immeasurable,
dwindling to nothing at all,
they call that a description of the indescribable.

Thinking about nothing at all,
they call that refusing to believe.

Welcoming it without seeing its face,
following it without seeing its back,
staying on today's road
by navigating today's reality,
by learning the lessons of the past,
they call that Daoji, rules of the road.

## English

In the old days,
good leaders must have been
quietly curious,
deeply intelligent,
ultimately inscrutable,
so loud sing their praise.

As cautious as a winter crossing,
as faithful as a trusted friend,
as respectful as a guest.

As chill as ice,
as true as timber,
as mixed up as melt water.

Who else could let melt water,
by stillness,
slowly settle?

Who else could let peace,
by movement,
slowly arise?

Those who took this path
didn't want to fill up
so could they save up
and not start from scratch.

## Notes

As [homogenous] as [turbulent/muddy water].

Don't use 眇 for 妙, this is MWD-ony thing. Guodian uses 妙.

I have no idea what to make of 達 and 通.  Their most common shared meaning seems to be something like "open", though they also both have the sense of something like unconventional. However, both imply something like penetrating below the surface of things, something like intuition? Introspective? Introverted?

不可志 as unpretentious (MWDA) goes nicely with loud sing their praise, but 深不可識 as unfathomable works pretty well, especially with deeply for 深.

豫與 can both mean participate, take part in, but what does that have to do with a fording a river in winter? 豫 can mean take precautions, which makes more sense to me, but 與 doesn't seem to have that meaning.

猶 and 猷 both can have the same meaning, 1) plan scheme, design, draw up, project 2) method means principle, but what does that have to do with 畏四鄰, respecting the neighbors?

嚴and 儼 of R both mean dignified, which goes nicely with ambassador for客, but 敢 of G goes nicely with pilgrim/apostle/traveler/outsider for 客. I have no idea what to make of R using 容 where WMD and G use 客.

[保葆服]此道者. The first character varies as 保 in G and R, and 葆 in MWD. I think this might be an attempt at a pun, because 葆 means "take" as in "take this road" but can mean hidden/concealed. 保 doesn't have that meaning, but could with a stretch. Perhaps 保 in R is a simplification that preserves the pun, somewhat. Wenzi and Huinanzi both use the more obvious 服 for "take this road".

I'm not sure what to make of 尚 in G's 不欲尚盈. There are no examples of 欲尚 or 尚盈 in ctext, or even of 欲上 or 上盈  (尚 and 上 seem to be synonyms) that can help make sense of this.

蔽 and 敝 both have the meaning of cover, conceal, protect, hide, which fits with the opening theme of obscurity, and this fits with the theme of the poem. Wenzi and Huinanzi both use 弊, with the same meaning. 蔽 and 敝 both have the meaning of destroy, which makes sense in opposition to 不(新)成, but 蔽 used in R, does not have this meaning.

The second half of the punchline is missing from G, not sure why. All R use 不新成, including Wenzi and Huinanzi, not 不成 as in MWD.

文子 九守 守弱 2 and 淮南子 道應訓 54 both use 不新成. Wenzi uses it in reference to a water clock that tips over when it's full and is upright when it empties.

## Notes

Variations:
[如佁若始殆]
- 如 here is the only instance in MWD, they use 若 in every other case, yet R seems to have transformed this into 若.
- 佁 appears only in B. In 4, A uses 始, and in R as 似, also a comparison word like 若. In 52, A and both R use 殆 where B uses 佁.
- It seems arguable to me that this started out as either 始 or 殆.
[累纍乘乘儽儽]
- Kroll says 累, 儽 and 儽儽 are all tired, worn out, depressed.
- 乘乘 is only in H and is associated with 窮鄙, down and out. It's also in History and Odes, but means "drive chariot", not relevant here.
望 and 忽
- Also paired in 14 and 21.
- In 14, where both MWD call 無物之象 as 忽望, both R call it 惚恍.
[忽澹惚昧悖費]
- WB uses 澹 here where both MWD and H use 忽.
- In 14, MWD contrast 不[收謬] with 不忽, and both R contrast 不皦 不昧.
- In 41, both R use 昧 where G uses 悖 and B uses 費. Missing in A.
- In 21, 忽 appears three times in all versions except once in WB, where it weirdly uses 惚, though it uses 忽 in the other two usages.
[望朢荒漂飂怳恍]
- Kroll has 望 but not 朢.
- In 20, A uses 望, B uses 朢 where R use 漂 and 飂.
- In 20, where R uses 荒, B uses 朢, and A is missing text here, presume 望.
- In 14, B uses 望, but A is missing here, and both R use 恍.
- In 21, A uses 望, B uses 朢, H uses 怳, and WB uses 恍 in all three usages, except one in which A is missing.
- Both R use 望 only in chapter 80, as does B. 80 is completely missing from A. 忽 is not present in any version of 80.
[佻垗兆]
- 佻 is in Kroll and means flippant/insulting.
- 垗 is not in Kroll, but it's in Shuo Wen as 畔, which can mean "contradict" according to Kroll.
- Kroll also has 挑 as a synonym of 佻, and on its own, can also mean flippant/insulting.
- I can't make any sense of plain old 兆 here.
[泊博怕薄]
- Both MWD use 泊 use as 薄, "scorn" in 38, and Kroll lists 泊 as a synonym of 薄.
- Both MWD and R use 博 in 81 to contrast with 知.
- B uses 博 in 54 where R both use 普. G and A are missing chars here.
- 怕 is used only here, and only in R.

Apostles of the open heart
are devoted only to the road.

Others on the road,
only to faith,

Between doubt and faith,
there's reason.

Between faith and doubt,
there's reality.

Between staying quiet and speaking up,
there's a calling.

Within a truly worthy calling,
there's commitment.

Till now from days of old,
our movement hasn't faltered
by remembering founding fathers.

It divides then unites,

ebbs then flows,
destroys then rebuilds,
shrinks then grows,
spreads then diversifies,

so the wise are committed to
applying this in their lives.

They don't explain it because it's clear,
don't prove it because it's obvious,
don't brag about it because it's worthwhile,
don't praise it because it's excellent,

and above all they don't argue
because no one can argue with it.

in perfection,

earth found balance
in peace,

spirit found balance
in wonder,

life found balance

lords and kings found balance
in bringing justice to the world.

Taken to the extreme,

endless perfection
would tear the universe apart,

endless peace
would shatter the earth,

endless wonder
would extinguish the gods,

endless bounty
would exhaust the fields,

endless ranks of aristocrats
would topple lords and kings.

Since they were elite
but remembered
that privilege is based on privation,

and since they were on top
but remembered
that authority comes from below,

lords and kings called themselves
lonely,
forsaken,
undeserving.

Is that really
remembering
that privilege is based on privation?

No, it's not.

Since the ultimate trick
is to play the part without pretending,

Principles

## Hanzi

道生一，
一生二，
二生三，
三生萬物。

萬物負陰
而抱陽，
沖氣以為和。

人之所惡，
惟孤，
寡，
不穀，
而王公
以為稱。

故物或損之而益，
或益之而損，
人之所教，
我亦教之，
強梁者不得其死。

吾將以為教父。

## English

Dao creates unity,
unity creates duality,
duality creates trinity,
trinity creates everything.

Everything is repelled by Yin, the negative,
and is attracted to Yang, the positive,
channels Qi, energy, to stay balanced.

People shun them,
the lonely orphan,
the forsaken,
the undeserving,
but kings and princes
took them as namesakes.

Since some things harmed them but helped,
and some helped them but harmed,
people taught them,
and we teach it too,
that tyrants don't live out their days.

I take this as my creed.

## Notes

[亞惡]
[唯惟]
[自為]
[益云云]

強梁者不得其死，is part of 強梁者不得其死，好勝者必遇其敵。 in Confucian texts. Tyrants don't live out their days, conquerors always meet their match.

不得其死 is more like, Don't die naturally. Impact worth the flip?

天下之至柔
馳騁於天下之至堅。

無有
入於無閒。

吾是以知
無為之有益也。

不言之教，
無為之益，
天下希能及之矣。

## English

The meekest
overtake the mightiest.

The insubstantial
permeates the impenetrable.

So I ponder
the substantial benefit of doing nothing.

Learn from silence,
get ahead by doing nothing,
the rest of the world can barely keep up.

身與貨
孰多？

得與亡
孰病？

甚愛必大費，
厚藏必多亡。

故知足不辱，
知止不殆，
可以長久。

## English

Reputation or character,
which is more important?

Character or money,
which is more valuable?

Profit or loss,
which is more trouble?

True love is so expensive,
a fortune is so much to lose.

Since there's no shame in realizing that you're content,
and no risk in realizing that it's time to stop,
that's how to let them grow and last.

## English

Leave life, join death.

Life's followers, three in ten,
death's followers, three in ten,
people's lives, get themselves killed, three in ten.

But why? They're just living their lives.

Perhaps you've heard of those who are good at staying alive.

They travel the world but don't fight bulls or hunt tigers,
join the army but don't wear armour or carry weapons.

There's nothing for the bull to smash with his horns.
nothing for the tiger to catch in her claws,
nothing for the soldier to hack with his sword.

But why? There's just nothing left to kill.

So everything reveres Dao

Reverence of Dao,

no one orders it to be so,

Dao creates us, tames us,
leads us, educates us,
builds us up, tears us down,
supports us, lets us down.

It creates us,

Changes us,

The strong give in and go with the flow,

In the world's love affairs,

it helps to be submissive.

When the strong give in to the weak,
they dominate the weak.
When the weak give in to the strong,
they take from the strong.
So sometimes give in to dominate,
and sometimes give in but receive.

So the strong don't pass up an opportunity to unite and shepherd others,
and the weak don't pass up an opportunity to join and follow others.

It's easy to keep the peace,
easy to plan the future,
easy to crush the vulnerable,
easy to give up on the weak.
Make them till they happen,
maintain them till they fall apart.

A tree of many arms around

starts from beneath your feet.

Making them breaks them,
keeping them abandons them.
Wise people make nothing
so nothing gets broken,
keep nothing
so nothing gets abandoned.
People always get hurt
when they accomplish something and try to hold on to it,
so be as cautious at the end as the beginning,
then nothing gets broken accidentally.

From this, a wise person
wants what others don't want
and doesn't set high standards,
learns what others haven't learned
and returns to the place everyone else has abandoned.
From there, they're able to affirm everything’s true nature,
and wouldn't dare force them.

故曰為道者，
非以明民也，
將以愚之也，
民之難治也，以其知也。
故以知邦，邦之賊也，
以不知邦，邦之德也。

恆知此兩者亦稽式也。
恆知稽式此謂玄德。
玄德深矣，

## English

Since they say follow the way
not by enlightening people,
but by keeping them in the dark,
people are hard to govern when they're aware.
Because when they notice government, they're against it,
when they don't notice government, they're for it.

Those who always keep this in mind just have to follow the signs.
Always knowing how to follow signs means Xuande, deep morality.
When deep morality is ingrained,
pervasive,
lets others disagree,
there's perfect harmony.

## English

Everyone says I'm important,
important, but odd.

Above all I'm important because I'm odd.

If I were normal for long,
I'd be irrelevant, wouldn't I?

I always have three treasures,
I maintain them and keep them safe.

The first is caution,
the second is restraint,
the third is not trying to get ahead in the world.

In the end, caution lets me be brave,
restraint lets me be generous,
not trying to get ahead in the world
lets me do excellent work.

These days,

when people refuse to be cautious
and insist on courage,

refuse to hold back
and insist on going for it,

refuse to go last
and insist on going first,

they end up dead.

In the end,
caution in war leads to victory,
in defense, to safety.

The universe empowers us
when caution protects us.

## Notes

The 不肖/肖 useless/normal joke is lost here. 不肖 is usually translated as "unworthy", and 肖 alone is something like "resemble". "Normal" is a stretch, but not outside the realm of possibility given that it's paired here with 細 in opposition to 大.

The character I've rendered as 兢 appears in Ctext as Mawangdui texts as 茲, and in received texts as 慈, or "love, compassion". 兢 is normally reduplicated and means something like "caution", but also appears alone quite often as something that can also be interpreted as "caution".

In any case, 廣 is matched with 檢 in the poem, which make sense in opposition, restraint and indulgence. 慈 is matched with 勇, which don't. The opposite of 勇 is shyness/fear/caution, not love/compassion. Interpreting this character as caution is heretical according to the accepted interpretation, but it's a lot more satisfying to me in tying the poem together.

So far I haven't found any images of the Mawangdui texts to definitively confirm or undermine my heretical interpretation :)

## English

They had something to say about waging war.

I won't risk playing the host but I'll play the guest,
I won't risk advancing an inch but I'll retreat a foot.

They called that
marching without orders,
taking without force,
occupying without soldiers,
advancing without enemies.

There's no greater mistake
than underestimating the enemy.

Scoffing at the enemy is a sign
that I've lost the advantage
because when opposing armies meet,
the aggrieved one wins.

## Notes

攘無臂 - If you go through ctext looking for instances of 攘臂, it means to roll up the sleeves and show the arms, and it's used in the context of people showing off or getting down to work. In English, I think it means something like "gird loins" or "flex muscles", so in my mind, the most likely interpretation of 攘無臂 in its context is something like, Flex where there are no muscles. Since deception in warfare is such an important element in ancient Chinese thought, I think this line reflection it.

Received texts use 輕 where the Mawangdui texts both use 無, changing the saying dramatically. The MWD version uses 近 to express the importance of knowing the enemy, or, in the received text, not underestimating them, so the meaning is similar, but very differently expressed.
