Ideas can be expressed,
but it's not a normal idea.

Words can be defined,
but it's not a normal word.

Nameless, the architect of heaven and earth,
named, the author of everything.

be subjective to discover how to describe it.

These couplets complement
but contradict each other.

Together, call them Xuan, mysterious veils.

Veil after veil,
a process of infinite subtlety.
