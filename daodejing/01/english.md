An idea can be expressed.
It's not a normal idea.

A word can be defined.
It's not a regular word.

Nameless, it's the author of heaven and earth.
Named, it's the mother of everything.

That's why we practice detachment, to witness its mystery.
It's why we're always yearning, to discover how to describe it.

These pairs produce each other,
but one defines the other.

They call each other shadow veil.

Veil upon veil,
the lessons of the eternal mystery.
