Ideas can be expressed,
but it's not a normal idea.

Words can be defined,
but it's not a normal word.

Nameless, it's the author of heaven and earth,
named, it explains everything.

be subjective to discover how to describe it.

These couplets complement
but contradict each other.

Together, call them Xuan, mysterious veils.

Veil upon veil,
a process of infinite subtlety.
