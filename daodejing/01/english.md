An idea can be expressed.
It's not a normal idea.

A word can be defined.
It's not a regular word.

Calling it nothing is the conception of heaven and earth.
Calling it something is the mother of ten thousand things.

That's why we practice wanting nothing, to observe its subtleties.
Always wanting something, observe how it's described.

These pairs emerge together
and each evokes the other.

Call each a veil.

Veil upon veil,
the gateway of many subtleties.
