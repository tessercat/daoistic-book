On the subtle process
of describing the indescribable.

The _Dao De Jing_ uses 謂
(often as 是謂,
"this is called"
or "defined as")
to name certain important concepts,
as it does here for 玄.

This poem is the only one
that defines 玄 alone,
not as part of a binomial.

Other named 玄 binomials
are in 6 (玄牝),
in 10, 51 and 65 (玄德),
and in 56 (玄同).

I think these terms
are key principles
of the moral arguments
presented in the _Dao De Jing_,
so in my English interpretation,
I've highlighted their importance
by rendering them first
in capitalized pinyin,
and I've interpreted them,
respectively,
as Xuanpin,
the female principle,
Xuande,
the moral principle
and Xuantong,
the principle of equivalence.

I don't think
it's too far fetched
to think of the _Dao De Jing_
as a collection of dialectic,
so I've used related terms here
when interpreting 玄.
