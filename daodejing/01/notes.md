道 is literally a road, a path,
but it's also patterns, principles, ideals.
As a verb it means
to express or to communicate,
which in turn evokes 名,
literally a name
but also a meaning, a definition.

The poem introduces 玄
as the shadowy veils,
the moral lessons (門),
that mark the passageway
to eternal mysteries (衆妙)
that lie beyond.
