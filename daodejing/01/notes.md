On the subtle process
of describing the indescribable.

The _Dao De Jing_ uses 謂
(often as 是謂,
"this is called"
or "defined as")
to name certain important concepts,
as it does here for 玄.

This poem is the only one
that defines 玄 alone,
not as part of a binomial.

Other named 玄 binomials
are in 6 (玄牝),
in 10, 51 and 65 (玄德),
and in 56 (玄同).
