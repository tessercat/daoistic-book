I'm pretty sure this poem
is about the process of
describing the indescribable,
so word choices flow from there.

This poem introduces
the important term 玄,
which I've rendered here as
"mystery" and "veil".
Kroll (first edition)
doesn't list "veil"
as a possible meaning,
but defines it as the quality of
permitting the passage of light
without making visible what's
on the other side.
I don't think I'm too far off.

The _Daodejing_ uses 謂
(often as 是謂, "this is called")
to name certain concepts,
as it does here,
and this poem is the only one
that defines 玄 alone,
and not as part of a binomial.
The other uses of 玄
in named binomials
are in 6 as 玄牝,
in 10, 51 and 65 as 玄德,
and in 56 as 玄同.
I think these named 玄 terms
are key concepts in the _Daodejing_,
so in my English interpretations,
I've capitalized the terms in pinyin,
and I've interpreted them
in English as, respectively,
Xuanpin, the veil of emptiness,
Xuande, the veil of morality
and Xuantong, the veil of equivalence.
I think these terms represent
core lessons in the unity of opposites.
