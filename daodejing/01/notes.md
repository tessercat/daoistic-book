I'm pretty sure this poem
is about the subtle process of
describing the indescribable.

I should say up front
that many of my word and grammar choices
are sometimes ... debatable,
to say the least,
but I want my interpretation to be
as pithy and patterned
as possible in English
as the original is in Chinese.

This poem introduces
the important term 玄,
which I've rendered here as
"mystery" and "veil".
Kroll (first edition)
doesn't list "veil"
as a possible meaning,
but defines 玄 as
the quality of permitting the passage of light
without making visible what's on the other side.

The _Daodejing_ uses 謂
(often as 是謂, "this is called")
to name certain concepts,
as it does here,
and this poem is the only one
that defines 玄 alone,
and not as part of a binomial.
Other named 玄 binomials
in the _Doadejing_
are in 6 (玄牝),
in 10, 51 and 65 (玄德),
and in 56 (玄同).
I think these terms
are key concepts in the _Daodejing_'s
philosophy of the unity of opposites,
so in my English interpretation,
I've highlighted their importance
by rendering them first
in capitalized pinyin.

In English,
I render them,
respectively,
as Xuanpin, the veil of emptiness,
Xuande, the veil of morality
and Xuantong, the veil of equivalence.
Kroll also lists "deep"
in the definition for 玄,
and I think the 玄 terms
might work just as well in English
as "deeply female",
"deeply moral"
and "deeply ambivalent",
but choices must be made,
after all,
and everything flows from there.
