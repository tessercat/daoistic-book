Hanzi versions of these poems
are based on comparison of
Guodian, Mawangdui, Heshangong and Wangbi
texts scraped from ctext in 2016.
Where one exists,
I pay close attention to Guodian,
and I read Scott Cook's notes carefully.
As much as I'm able,
I try to reconcile Guoadian to Wangbi,
and where no Guodian version exists,
I prefer Wangbi.

Having said that,
Wangbi and Heshangong seem often to drop 也
and other particles (之 in particular)
where they appear in other versions,
so I retain them in my own version where they
exist in Guodian or Mawangdui
but don't in Wangbi.
