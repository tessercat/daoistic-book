道 is literally a road, a path,
but it's also patterns,
principles,
ideals.
As a verb it means
to express
or to communicate.

名 is literally a name,
but also a meaning,
a definition.

常 is normally translated
in the first two couplets as
enduring or long-lasting,
but it can also mean
ordinary
or normal,
and I prefer that ere.

常 also appears in the phrases
that I've interpreted as
"be objective"
(常無欲 - 常 have no desire)
and "be subjective"
(常有欲 - 常 have desire).

The poem introduces
the important term 玄,
which I've rendered here as
"mystery" and "mysterious veil".
As an adjective,
Kroll (first edition)
defines it as the quality of
permitting the passage of light
without making visible what's
on the other side.
As a noun,
it's more something like "mystery",
and not something concrete like "veil",
but I'm OK with that.

Kroll also points out
the use of 玄 in Daoism
as a synonym for 道, Dao.
It's something mysterious
that can't be fully known or described.

The _Daodejing_ uses 謂
(often as 是謂, "this is called")
to name certain concepts,
as it does here,
and this poem is the only one
that defines 玄 alone,
and not as part of a binomial.
The other uses of 玄
as named binomials
are in 6 as 玄牝,
in 10, 51 and 65 as 玄德,
and in 56 as 玄同.
I think these named 玄 terms
are key concepts in the _Daodejing_,
so in my English interpretations,
I've capitalized the terms in pinyin,
and I've interpreted them
in English as, respectively,
Xuanpin, the veil of the emptiness,
Xuande, the veil of morality
and Xuantong, the veil of equivalence,
I think these terms represent
core lessons in the unity of opposites
that contradict but complement
each other (同出而異名).
They're shadowy veils,
the moral lessons
that mark the passageway (門)
to the next subtle lesson (妙)
that lies beyond.
