# Death

## Hanzi

出生
入死。

生之徒，十有三，
死之徒，十有三，
人之生，動之死地，十有三。

夫何故也？
以其生，生之厚也。

蓋聞善
執生者。

路行
不遇兕虎，

入軍
不被甲兵。

兕無所投其角，
虎無所措其爪，
兵無所容其刃。

夫何故也？
以其無死地。

## English

We come out and live,
go back when we die.

Three in ten fight to live,
three in ten long for death,
three in ten love life so much it kills them.

But why are they like that?
They're alive, so they're full of life.

Maybe you've heard of
people who are good at staying alive.

They travel the world
but don't face bulls or tigers.

They join the army
but don't carry shields or weapons.

There's nothing for bulls to smash with their horns,
nothing for tigers to catch in their claws,
nothing for soldiers to hack with their swords.

But why are they like that?
They have nothing left to kill.
