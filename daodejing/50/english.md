We come out and live,
go back when we die.

Three in ten fight to live,
three in ten long for death,
three in ten love life so much it kills them.

But why are they like that?
They're alive, so they're full of life.

Maybe you've heard of
people who are good at staying alive.

They travel the world
but don't face bulls or tigers.

They join the army
but don't carry shields or weapons.

There's nothing for bulls to smash with their horns,
nothing for tigers to catch in their claws,
nothing for soldiers to hack with their swords.

But why are they like that?
They have nothing left to kill.
