Of things that found balance long ago,

the universe found balance
in perfection,

earth found balance
in peace,

spirit found balance
in wonder,

life found balance
in plenty,

lords and kings found balance
in bringing justice to the world.

Taken to the extreme,

endless perfection
would tear the universe apart,

endless peace
would shatter the earth,

endless wonder
would extinguish the gods,

endless bounty
would exhaust the fields,

endless ranks of privileged elites
would topple lords and kings.

That's why they were elite
but remembered
that privilege is based on privation,

and they were on top
but remembered
that authority comes from below.

Lords and kings call themselves
lonely,
forsaken,
undeserving.

Is that really
remembering
that privilege is based on privation?

No, it's not.

That's why the ultimate trick
is to play the part without pretending.

Don't try to look polished like jade,
look plain like granite.
