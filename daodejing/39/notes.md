R: X without the means to Y will eventually Z.
MWD: X without stopping Y will eventually Z.

[霝靈]
[浴谷]
Only in R: 萬物得一以生 and 萬物無以生將恐滅
[正貞]
[致至]
MWD have 胃X毌已 where R have X無以
[蓮裂]
[渴竭]
MWD both have 貴以高, both R have 以貴高 with 以 as part of the general pattern.
MWD and R also differ in pattern in the 貴 高 passage, but main characters are the same.
MWD lead with 夫是以 where R have only 是以.
[謂稱]
[穀轂]
MWD are missing the first [非] in the rhetorical question.
[輿譽]
[若如]
[祿祿|琭琭]
[硌硌|珞珞]

玉 and 石 are contrasted in ctext, so maybe the rdup should as well. Perhaps 碌碌 for [硌硌|珞珞]? HSG has 落落 in notes, which had the right pronunciation, but not quite the right meaning.
