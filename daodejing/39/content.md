昔之得一者，

天得一
以清。

地得一
以寧。

神得一
以靈。

谷得一
以盈。

侯王得一
以天下為正。

其至之也，

天無已清
將恐裂。

地無已寧
將恐發。

神無已靈
將恐歇。

谷無已盈
將恐竭。

侯王無已貴以高
將恐蹶。

故必貴
而以
賤為本，

必高矣
而以
下為基，

夫是以侯王自謂
孤
寡，
不穀。

此非
以
賤為本耶？

非也。

故至數
譽無譽。

不欲琭琭若玉，
碌碌若石。

## English

Of things that found balance long ago,

the universe found balance
in perfection,

earth found balance
in peace,

spirit found balance
in wonder,

life found balance
in plenty,

lords and kings found balance
in bringing justice to the world.

Taken to the extreme,

endless perfection
would tear the universe apart,

endless peace
would shatter the earth,

endless wonder
would extinguish the gods,

endless bounty
would exhaust the fields,

endless ranks of privileged elites
would topple lords and kings.

That's why they were elite
but remembered
that privilege is based on privation,

and they were on top
but remembered
that authority comes from below.

Lords and kings call themselves
lonely,
forsaken,
undeserving.

Is that really
remembering
that privilege is based on privation?

No, it's not.

That's why the ultimate trick
is to play the part without pretending.

Don't try to look polished like jade,
look plain like granite.
