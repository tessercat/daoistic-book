# Greatness

## Hanzi

道汎呵，
其可左右也。
成功遂事，
而弗名有也。

萬物歸焉
而弗為主，
則恆無欲也，
可名於小。

萬物歸焉
而弗為主
可命於大。

是以聖人之能成大也，
以其不為大也。

故能成大。

## English

The winding way
might go left or right.
Getting it done, following orders,
but not getting credit for it.

If everyone would have faith in it
and not try to act important,
they'd want for nothing,
and might get credit for something small.

Everyone who has faith in it
and doesn't try to act important
might even get asked to do something great.

So the ability of the wise to become great
depends on not acting great.

It's what lets them do great things.
