天下皆知美之為美，
斯惡已。

皆知善，
斯不善已。

故

有無之相生也，
難易之相成也，

長短之相形也，
高下之相呈也，

音聲之相和也，
先後之相隨也，

是以聖人居無為之事，
行不言之教。

萬物作而弗治也，
為而弗志也，
成而弗居。

夫唯弗居也
是以弗去也。

## English

Everyone thinks that beauty is what makes us beautiful,
but it's our flaws.

We all think we're right
when we're wrong.

It's because

something and nothing create each other,
hard and easy become each other,

long and short measure each other,
high and low average each other,

cause and effect balance each other,
before and after follow each other.

So the wise are in the business of doing nothing,
take orders from silence.

They organize things but don't control them,
manage but don't force them,
build but don't stay there.

Above all they don't stay there
so they don't get left behind.
