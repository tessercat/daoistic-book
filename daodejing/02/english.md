Everyone thinks that beauty is what makes us beautiful,
but it's our flaws.

We all think we're right
when we're wrong.

Something and nothing create each other,
hard and easy become each other.

Long and short measure each other,
high and low average each other.

Cause and effect balance each other,
before and after follow each other.

So the wise are in the business of doing nothing,
take orders from silence.

They organize things but don't control them,
manage but don't force them,
build but don't stay there.

Above all they don't stay there
so they don't get left behind.
