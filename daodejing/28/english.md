Mind the rooster, protect the hen,
build a chicken coop for the world.

A high quality coop isn't a cage,
it takes us back to innocence.

Mind the crop, protect it from weeds,
plant a garden for the world.

A high quality garden is just enough,
it takes us back to nature.

Mind what's right, protect it from wrong,
set standards for the world.

High quality standards aren't strict,
they take us back to freedom.

When timber splits, improvise,
and when the wise approve, make it official,

In the grand scheme of things,
there are no mistakes.
