知其雄守其雌
為天下谿

為天下谿恆德不離
恆德不離復歸於嬰兒

知其榮守其辱
為天下谷

為天下谷恆德乃足
恆德乃足復歸於朴

知其白守其黑
為天下式

為天下式恆德不忒
恆德不忒復歸於無極

樸散則為器
聖人用則為官長

夫大制
無割

## English

Mind the rooster, protect the hen,
build a chicken coop for the world.

A high quality coop isn't a cage,
it takes us back to innocence.

Mind the crop, protect it from weeds,
plant a garden for the world.

A high quality garden is just enough,
it takes us back to nature.

Mind what's right, protect it from wrong,
set standards for the world.

High quality standards aren't strict,
they take us back to freedom.

When timber splits, improvise,
and when the wise approve, make it official,

In the grand scheme of things,
there are no mistakes.
