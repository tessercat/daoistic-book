# Ambition

## Hanzi

為學者日益
為道者日損

損之有損
以至於無為也

無為而無不為。

取天下恆
以無事。

及其有事也，
不足以取天下。

## English

Practice every day and get better,
follow the way every day and get worse.

Get worse and worse
till you end up doing nothing.

Doing nothing, but nothing's left undone.

Always get ahead in the world
by having no work to do.

When there's work to do,
getting ahead isn't important.
