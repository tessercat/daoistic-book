Stay on track by backing good leaders,
don't fight wars to get your way in the world.

Good ones get results and nothing more,
they don't get their way by force.

They get results but don't hurt anyone,
don't bully anyone,
don't threaten anyone.

They call it getting results
but not getting their way.

It's worth the effort.
