# Leadership

## Hanzi

以道佐人主者
不欲以兵強於天下。

善者果而已
不以取強。

果而弗伐。
果而弗驕。
果而弗矜。

是謂果
而不強。

其事好長。

## English

Stay on track by backing good leaders,
don't fight wars to get your way in the world.

Good ones get results and nothing more,
they don't get their way by force.

They get results but don't hurt anyone,
don't bully anyone,
don't threaten anyone.

They call it getting results
but not getting their way.

It's worth the effort.
