It divides and unites,
bends and straightens,
ebbs and flows,
destroys and rebuilds,
shrinks and grows,
spreads and diversifies.

So the wise are committed to
applying this in their lives.

They don't explain it because it's clear,
don't prove it because it's obvious,
don't brag about it because it's worthwhile,
don't praise it because it's excellent,

and above all they don't argue
because no one can argue with it.

What the ancients said
about division and unity,
was it false doctrine?

They were true believers
but came back to it.
