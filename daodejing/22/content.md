## Hanzi

曲則全，
枉則正，
窪則盈，
敝則新，
少則得，
多則惑。

是以聖人抱一，
以為天下式。

不自見故明，
不自視故彰，
不自伐故有功，
不自矜故長，

夫唯不爭
故莫能與之爭。

古之所謂
曲全者，
豈虛言哉。

誠全
而歸之。

## English

It divides and unites,
bends and straightens,
ebbs and flows,
destroys and rebuilds,
shrinks and grows,
spreads and diversifies.

So the wise are committed to
applying this in their lives.

They don't explain it because it's clear,
don't prove it because it's obvious,
don't brag about it because it's worthwhile,
don't praise it because it's excellent,

and above all they don't argue
because no one can argue with it.

What the ancients said
about dividing and uniting,
was it false doctrine?

They were true believers
but came back to it.
