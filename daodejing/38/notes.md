Since this poem
is such a key statement
of the _Dao De Jing_'s vocabulary,
and since I make so many
...arguable word choices
here and elsewhere,
I'll just justify myself
here and in general.

I read, write and speak
exactly one language,
English.

I'm illiterate
in Chinese language,
culture
and history,
though I've taken classes
in history and culture,
and I've lived in Japan.

I try to stay
as true to Kroll
as I'm able.

I read Cook's footnotes
very closely
as a sanity check
when I work on Guodian poems.

I like chasing vocabulary around
in ctext.

I realize that
the people who first
crafted these poems
were deeply learned
in a deeply literate
tradition of moral philosophy
that's at least somewhat
lost it time,
and mostly foreign to me
in language and culture.

I affirm that
the _Dao De Jing_ riffs on
universal themes,
and that it's possible
for me at least to appreciate
their point of view,
if not fully understand
their context
or express them
accurately or poetically
in my own language.

The poems are jazzy and pithy
in Chinese.
They're memorable,
they rhyme,
and they have a beat.
I try to channel that
into English.

I don't try to
preserve or introduce rhymes,
but I like to alliterate.

I try very hard
to preserve patterns
of grammar and vocabulary
as much as I'm able.

I like to call
my errors and liberties
poetic license.
