The highly moral are moral
because they don't moralize,
and the least moral are immoral
because they can't stop moralizing.

The highly moral do nothing
and expect nothing,
and when the least moral do something,
they expect something in return.

When the truly kind do something,
they expect nothing,
and when the highly responsible do it,
they do what's expected.

When the truly righteous do something
and no one goes along with it,
when they threaten and denounce us,
they've lost the way.

They've lost the way
and they're not moral.

They're not moral
and they're not kind.

They're not kind
and they're not responsible.

They're not responsible
and they're not righteous.

Does a righteous man,
an authority on legitimacy,
incite us to violence?

Does a visionary,
a prophet of God,
take us for fools?

So a truly great leader
relies on respect, not authority,
on facts, not dogma,
and stays away from one to get the other.
