The highly moral have character
because they don't moralize,
and the least moral have no character
because they never stop.

The highly moral do nothing
and expect nothing,
but when the least moral do something,
they expect something in return.

When the truly kind do something,
they expect nothing in return,
and when the highly responsible do something,
they do what's expected.

When the truly righteous do something
and no one is moved,
when they rouse us to anger,
we've lost our way.

We're lost
and we're no longer moral.

We have no character
and we're no longer kind.

We've lost our humanity
and we take no responsibility.

We fail in our duty
and we have no right.

We're the righteous
who cry for justice,
yet we incite them to violence.

We're the visionaries
who show them the way,
yet we take them for fools.

So true moral authority
lies in hope, not hatred,
in fact, not fiction.

So reject one,
claim the other.
