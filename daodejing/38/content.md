上德不德
是以有德
下德不失德
是以無德

上德無為
而無以為也
下德為之
而有以為也

上仁為之
而無以為也
上義為之
而有以為也

上禮為之
而莫之應也
則攘臂而扔之
故失道

失道矣
而後德

失德
而後仁

失仁
而後義

失義
而後禮

夫禮者
忠信之薄也
而亂之首也

前識者
道之華也
而愚之首也

是以大丈夫
居其厚而不居其薄
居其實而不居其華
故去彼取此

## English

The highly moral are moral
because they don't moralize,
and the least moral are immoral
because they can't stop moralizing.

The highly moral do nothing
and expect nothing,
and when the least moral do something,
they expect something in return.

When the truly kind do something,
they expect nothing,
and when the highly responsible do it,
they do what's expected.

When the truly righteous do something
and no one goes along with it,
when they threaten and denounce us,
they've lost the way.

They've lost the way
and they're not moral.

They're not moral
and they're not kind.

They're not kind
and they're not responsible.

They're not responsible
and they're not righteous.

Does a righteous man,
an authority on legitimacy,
incite us to violence?

Does a visionary,
a prophet of God,
take us for fools?

So a truly great leader
relies on respect, not authority,
on facts, not dogma,
and stays away from one to get the other.
