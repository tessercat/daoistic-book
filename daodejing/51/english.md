Dao creates us
but De tames us.

Nature forms us
but nurture finishes us.

So everything reveres Dao
but respects De.

Reverence of Dao,
respect of De,
no one orders it to be so,
but it's always like that.

Dao creates us, tames us,
leads us, educates us,
builds us up, tears us down,
supports us, lets us down.

It creates us,
but doesn't own us.

Changes us,
but doesn't tell us.

Leads us
but doesn't rule us.

They say it's Xuande, deeply moral.
