# Morality

## Hanzi

道生之
而德畜之。

物刑之
而器成之。

是以萬物尊道
而貴德。

道之尊，
德之貴也，
夫莫之[爵命]
而恆自[祭然]也。

道生之，畜之，
長之，[遂育]之，
亭之，毒之，
養之，覆之。

生
而弗有也，

為
而弗[寺恃]也，

長
而弗宰也。

此之謂玄德。

## English

Dao creates us
but De tames us.

Nature forms us
but nurture finishes us.

So everything reveres Dao
but respects De.

Reverence of Dao,
respect of De,
no one orders it to be so,
but it's always like that.

Dao creates us, tames us,
leads us, educates us,
builds us up, tears us down,
supports us, lets us down.

It creates us,
but doesn't own us.

Changes us,
but doesn't tell us.

Leads us
but doesn't rule us.

They say it's Xuande, deeply moral.
