# Victory

## Hanzi

用兵有言曰。

吾不敢為主而為客，
吾不敢進寸而退尺。

是謂
行無行，
攘無臂，
執無兵，
仍無敵矣。

禍莫大
於輕敵。

輕敵幾
喪吾寶，
故抗兵相加，
則哀者勝矣。

## English

They had something to say about waging war.

I won't risk playing the host but I'll play the guest,
I won't risk advancing an inch but I'll retreat a foot.

They called that
marching without orders,
taking without force,
occupying without soldiers,
advancing without enemies.

There's no greater mistake
than underestimating the enemy.

Scoffing at the enemy is a sign
that I've lost the advantage
because when opposing armies meet,
the aggrieved one wins.
