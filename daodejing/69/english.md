They had something to say about waging war.

I won't risk playing the host but I'll play the guest,
I won't risk advancing an inch but I'll retreat a foot.

They called that
marching without orders,
taking without force,
occupying without soldiers,
advancing without enemies.

There's no greater mistake
than underestimating the enemy.

Scoffing at the enemy is a sign
that I've lost the advantage
because when opposing armies meet,
the aggrieved one wins.
