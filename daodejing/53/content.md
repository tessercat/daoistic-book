# Bragging Thieves

## Hanzi

使我[潔|介|介然]有知也，
行於大道，
唯[他施]是畏。

大道甚夷，
民甚好[解徑]，
朝甚除，
田甚蕪，
倉甚虛。

服文[采綵]，
帶利劍，
厭食而齎財有餘，
是謂盜[誇夸]。

非道也。

## English

Seeing things clearly as
walk on the great way,
I just get overwhelmed.

The great way is too run down,
the people are too licentious,
governments are too out of touch,
fields are too overgrown with weeds,
granaries are too empty.

Dressed in the latest fashion,
armed with deadly weapons,
too much money, too many things,
that's just bragging about stealing,

it's the wrong way.
