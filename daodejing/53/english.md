If you ask me to explain
how to do the right thing
I'm afraid I might just say,

The high road is easy
but people like shortcuts.

You've shut down the government,
the fields are fallow,
the granaries are empty.

You wear silk robes
and carry a sharp sword.

You stuff your face
and line your pockets,
and still want more.

That makes you a tyrant.

Definitely a dead end.
