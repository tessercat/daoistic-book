If you ask me to explain
how to do the right thing
I'm afraid I might just say,

The high road is easy
but people like shortcuts.

You've shut down government,
fields are fallow,
granaries are empty.

You wear silk robes
and carry a sharp sword.

You stuff your face
and line your pockets,
and still want more.

That makes you a tyrant.

Definitely a dead end.
