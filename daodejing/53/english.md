Seeing things clearly as
walk on the great way,
I just get overwhelmed.

The great way is too run down,
the people are too licentious,
governments are too out of touch,
fields are too overgrown with weeds,
granaries are too empty.

Dressed in the latest fashion,
armed with deadly weapons,
too much money, too many things,
that's just bragging about stealing,

it's the wrong way.
