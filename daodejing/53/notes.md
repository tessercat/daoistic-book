This is one of two poems
in the _Dao De Jing_
to use the term 大道.

It's literally "main street",
and Heshanggong commentary
adds a related Laozi saying
that goes something like,
"In public life,
I follow main street,
In private life,
I conform by doing nothing."

In [chapter 18](/studies/18),
a public figure
who strays too far from it
gets preachy,
and here,
the author explains
why it's a good idea
to avoid public life
when tyrants rule.
