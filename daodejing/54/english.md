Good foundations don't crumble,
good bonds aren't easy to break,
and family lines don't end when they follow tradition.

Cultivated within,
their morality becomes reality.

Nurtured in the family,
their morality gathers momentum.

Practiced in the community,
their morality becomes growth.

Fostered in the nation,
their morality becomes abundance.

Promoted in society,
their morality becomes maturity.

Every person has them,
every family has them,
every community has them,
every government has them,
every society has them.

So how do I know what society is like?
Like this.
