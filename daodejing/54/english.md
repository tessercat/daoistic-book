Good foundations don't crumble,
good bonds aren't easy to break,
and family lines don't end when they follow tradition.

Cultivate them within,
their morality becomes reality.

Practice them as a family,
their morality gathers momentum.

Promote them in the community,
their morality becomes growth.

Teach them in the nation,
their morality becomes abundance.

Practice them in society,
their morality becomes tolerance.

Every person has them,
every family has them,
every community has them,
every nation has them,
every society has them.

So how do I know what society is like?
Like this.
