Good foundations don't crumble,
good bonds don't break,
families don't falter by following tradition.

Cultivate this within,
its character takes shape.

Nurture it in the family,
its character quickens.

Practice it in the community,
its character grows.

Promote it in the nation,
its character flourishes.

Inspire it in the world,
its character matures.

I discover it within,
cherish it in families,
celebrate it in communities,
respect it in nations,
contemplate it in the world.

So how do I know what people are like?

Like that.
