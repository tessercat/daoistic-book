善建者不拔
善抱者不脫
子孫以其祭祀不輟

修之身
其德乃真

修之家
其德有餘

修之鄉
其德乃長

修之國
其德乃豐

修之天下
其德乃博

以身觀身
以家觀家
以鄉觀鄉
以國觀國
以天下觀天下

吾何以知天下之然
以此

## English

Good foundations don't crumble,
good bonds aren't easy to break,
and family lines don't end when they follow tradition.

Cultivate them within,
their morality becomes reality.

Practice them as a family,
their morality gathers momentum.

Promote them in the community,
their morality becomes growth.

Teach them in the nation,
their morality becomes abundance.

Practice them in society,
their morality becomes tolerance.

Every person has them,
every family has them,
every community has them,
every nation has them,
every society has them.

So how do I know what society is like?
Like this.
