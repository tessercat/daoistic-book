This and a few other poems
convince me that the _Dao De Jing_
is in some ways
deeply conservative.
Here it promotes
healthy relationships
rooted in
personal character
and family values.

My reading of the poem
reflects my thoughts
on Daoist moral physics.

As in any natural system,
morality in human societies
arises from individuals
who cultivate personal character
according to moral law
bestowed upon us
by the heavens.

Moral law
is discernible to us
by contemplation
of lasting phenomena,
and the lesson here
is on stability and continuity,
and how it applies
at all levels
of human society.

The observations/judgements
in the third section
answer the question,
"How I can know
what's healthy and moral
in myself and in society?"

I ask myself,
are my habits
and relationships
stable and healthy?
Are my children well-raised
and well-loved?
Is society established
and integrated?

If so,
that's character,
and it's what lasts.
