This and a few other poems
convince me that the _Dao De Jing_
is in some ways
deeply conservative.
Here it promotes
healthy human relationships
rooted in
and personal character
and family values.

Some of my word choices
in English
mix metaphors
in ways that aren't literally correct
in classical Chinese,
but I've tried to preserve
the primary metaphor
of human societies
as systems of plants or trees.

The first saying
is specifically about family lines,
but I think its observation
on the importance of
roots and relationships
is meant to be applied
to human systems
at all levels,
including individuals.

My reading of the poem
also reflects my thoughts
on Daoist moral physics in general.

As in natural systems,
morality in human societies
arises from individuals
who cultivate personal character
according to moral law
bestowed upon us
by the heavens,
and discernible to us
by contemplation
of what lasts.
