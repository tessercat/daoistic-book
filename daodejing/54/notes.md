This and a few other poems
convince me that the _Dao De Jing_
is in some ways
deeply conservative.

Here it promotes
healthy, stable, lasting
habits and relationships
rooted in
personal character
and family values.

The first saying
presents vocabulary
to be applied in the second saying
and observed in the third.
It's virtues to cultivate,
and criteria for moral judgement.

The virtues
of healthy individuals and societies
are established,
unshakeable habits and traditions,
unbreakable relationships,
and an unflagging reverence
for those who came before.
