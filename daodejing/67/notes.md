The 不肖/肖 useless/normal joke is lost here. 不肖 is usually translated as "unworthy", and 肖 alone is something like "resemble". "Normal" is a stretch, but not outside the realm of possibility given that it's paired here with 細 in opposition to 大.

The character I've rendered as 兢 appears in Ctext as Mawangdui texts as 茲, and in received texts as 慈, or "love, compassion". 兢 is normally reduplicated and means something like "caution", but also appears alone quite often as something that can also be interpreted as "caution".

In any case, 廣 is matched with 檢 in the poem, which make sense in opposition, restraint and indulgence. 慈 is matched with 勇, which don't. The opposite of 勇 is shyness/fear/caution, not love/compassion. Interpreting this character as caution is heretical according to the accepted interpretation, but it's a lot more satisfying to me in tying the poem together.

So far I haven't found any images of the Mawangdui texts to definitively confirm or undermine my heretical interpretation :)
