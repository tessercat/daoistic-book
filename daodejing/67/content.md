天下皆謂我大，
大而不肖。

夫唯大故不肖。

若肖久矣，
其細也夫。

我恆有三葆
持而保之。

一曰兢，
二曰檢，
三曰不敢為天下先。

夫兢故能勇，
檢故能廣，
不敢為天下先
故能為成事長。

今，

舍其兢
且勇，

舍其檢
且廣，

舍其後
且先，

則必死矣。

夫
兢以戰則勝，
以守則固。

天將建之，
如以兢垣之。

## English

Everyone says I'm important,
important, but odd.

Above all I'm important because I'm odd.

If I were normal for long,
I'd be irrelevant, wouldn't I?

I always have three treasures,
I maintain them and keep them safe.

The first is caution,
the second is restraint,
the third is not trying to get ahead in the world.

In the end, caution lets me be brave,
restraint lets me be generous,
not trying to get ahead in the world
lets me do excellent work.

These days,

when people refuse to be cautious
and insist on courage,

refuse to hold back
and insist on going for it,

refuse to go last
and insist on going first,

they end up dead.

In the end,
caution in war leads to victory,
in defense, to safety.

The universe empowers us
when caution protects us.
