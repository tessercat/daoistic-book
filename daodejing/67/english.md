Everyone says I'm important,
important, but odd.

Above all I'm important because I'm odd.

If I were normal for long,
I'd be irrelevant, wouldn't I?

I always have three treasures,
I maintain them and keep them safe.

The first is caution,
the second is restraint,
the third is not trying to get ahead in the world.

In the end, caution lets me be brave,
restraint lets me be generous,
not trying to get ahead in the world
lets me do excellent work.

These days,

when people refuse to be cautious
and insist on courage,

refuse to hold back
and insist on going for it,

refuse to go last
and insist on going first,

they end up dead.

In the end,
caution in war leads to victory,
in defense, to safety.

The universe empowers us
when caution protects us.
