# Selfishness

## Hanzi

天長地久。

天地之所以
能長且久者
以其不自生也。

故能長生，
是以聖人芮其身而身先，
外其身而身存。

不以其無私輿，
故能成其私。

## English

The universe is vast, the earth is ancient.

The reason that heaven and earth
could grow and last
is that they don't live for themselves.

Since that's what lets us grow and live,
the wise put themselves last but lead,
look beyond themselves but endure.

Shouldn't we be unselfish
since that's what lets us become ourselves?
