The universe is vast, the earth is ancient.

How did heaven and earth get so big and old?

By not living for themselves.
That's what lets them live so long.

So the wise put themselves last but lead,
look beyond themselves but endure.

Shouldn't we be unselfish
since that's what lets us become ourselves?
