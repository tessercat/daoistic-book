以正治國
以奇用兵
以無事取天下

吾何以知其然也

以此

天下多忌諱
而民彌叛

民多利器
而國滋昏

人多智
而奇物滋起

法物滋章
盜賊多有

是以聖人之言曰

我無事
而民自富

我無為
而民自化

我好靜
而民自正

我欲不欲
而民自樸

## English

Lead the nation predictably,
wage war unpredictably,
conquer the world by doing nothing.

How do I know it's true?

Like this.

When the world has too many morals,
people

When people profit instruments,
the country is dark.

When people are too talented and clever,
strange things start happening.

When laws pass,
too many thieves and bandits exist.

So the wise tell themselves,

We should provide nothing
and people will provide for themselves.

We should do nothing
and people will work it out for themselves.

We should just keep quiet
and people will straighten it out for themselves.

We should try to expect nothing
and people will figure it out for themselves.
