Lead the nation predictably,
wage war unpredictably,
conquer the world by doing nothing.

How do I know it's true?

Like this.

When the world has too many morals,
people

When people profit instruments,
the country is dark.

When people are too talented and clever,
strange things start happening.

When laws pass,
too many thieves and bandits exist.

So the wise tell themselves,

We should provide nothing
and people will provide for themselves.

We should do nothing
and people will work it out for themselves.

We should just keep quiet
and people will straighten it out for themselves.

We should try to expect nothing
and people will figure it out for themselves.
