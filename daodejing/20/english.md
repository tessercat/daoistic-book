Stop debating,
there's no point.

Consent and concede,
how are they different?

Good and evil,
how are they the same?

Be it resolved that what some people consider sacred
should not be used to demonize others.

They were so enthusiastic,
even before it started.

Everyone was excited,
like they were at the village fair
and they were raising the maypole.

I stayed out of it, not even a joke,
like a newborn, not even a smile.

It was so depressing,
like I was the village idiot.

Everyone else got it
and I just got lost.

My poor brain,
I was so confused.

Their arguments were brilliant,
and I was just so dim.

Their arguments were incisive,
and I was just so dull.

It was so overwhelming,
like I was lost at sea.

It was so abstract,
like nothing was true.

Everyone else had what it takes,
and I was just a small town hick.

We just wanted different things,
and I yearned for mother's milk.
