絕學
無憂。

唯與阿，
其相去幾何。

美與惡，
其相去何若。

人之所畏，
亦不可以不畏人。

望呵，
其未央才。

眾人熙熙，
若鄉於大牢，
而春登臺。

我薄焉，未佻，
若嬰兒，未孩。

儽儽呵，
若無所歸。

眾人皆有餘，
而我獨遺。

我愚人之心也，
蠢蠢呵。

鬻人昭昭，
我獨若昏呵。

鬻人察察，
我獨悶悶呵。

忽呵，
其若海。

望呵，
其若無所止。

眾人皆有以，
而我獨頑似鄙。

吾欲獨異於人，
而貴食母。

## English

Stop debating,
there's no point.

Consent and concede,
how are they different?

Good and evil,
how are they the same?

Be it resolved that what some people consider sacred
should not be used to demonize others.

They were so enthusiastic,
even before it started.

Everyone was excited,
like they were at the village fair
and they were raising the maypole.

I stayed out of it, not even a joke,
like a newborn, not even a smile.

It was so depressing,
like I was the village idiot.

Everyone else got it
and I just got lost.

My poor brain,
I was so confused.

Their arguments were brilliant,
and I was just so dim.

Their arguments were incisive,
and I was just so dull.

It was so overwhelming,
like I was lost at sea.

It was so abstract,
like nothing was true.

Everyone else had what it takes,
and I was just a small town hick.

We just wanted different things,
and I yearned for mother's milk.
