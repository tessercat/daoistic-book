Variations:
[如佁若始殆]
- 如 here is the only instance in MWD, they use 若 in every other case, yet R seems to have transformed this into 若.
- 佁 appears only in B. In 4, A uses 始, and in R as 似, also a comparison word like 若. In 52, A and both R use 殆 where B uses 佁.
- It seems arguable to me that this started out as either 始 or 殆.
[累纍乘乘儽儽]
- Kroll says 累, 儽 and 儽儽 are all tired, worn out, depressed.
- 乘乘 is only in H and is associated with 窮鄙, down and out. It's also in History and Odes, but means "drive chariot", not relevant here.
望 and 忽
- Also paired in 14 and 21.
- In 14, where both MWD call 無物之象 as 忽望, both R call it 惚恍.
[忽澹惚昧悖費]
- WB uses 澹 here where both MWD and H use 忽.
- In 14, MWD contrast 不[收謬] with 不忽, and both R contrast 不皦 不昧.
- In 41, both R use 昧 where G uses 悖 and B uses 費. Missing in A.
- In 21, 忽 appears three times in all versions except once in WB, where it weirdly uses 惚, though it uses 忽 in the other two usages.
[望朢荒漂飂怳恍]
- Kroll has 望 but not 朢.
- In 20, A uses 望, B uses 朢 where R use 漂 and 飂.
- In 20, where R uses 荒, B uses 朢, and A is missing text here, presume 望.
- In 14, B uses 望, but A is missing here, and both R use 恍.
- In 21, A uses 望, B uses 朢, H uses 怳, and WB uses 恍 in all three usages, except one in which A is missing.
- Both R use 望 only in chapter 80, as does B. 80 is completely missing from A. 忽 is not present in any version of 80.
[佻垗兆]
- 佻 is in Kroll and means flippant/insulting.
- 垗 is not in Kroll, but it's in Shuo Wen as 畔, which can mean "contradict" according to Kroll.
- Kroll also has 挑 as a synonym of 佻, and on its own, can also mean flippant/insulting.
- I can't make any sense of plain old 兆 here.
[泊博怕薄]
- Both MWD use 泊 use as 薄, "scorn" in 38, and Kroll lists 泊 as a synonym of 薄.
- Both MWD and R use 博 in 81 to contrast with 知.
- B uses 博 in 54 where R both use 普. G and A are missing chars here.
- 怕 is used only here, and only in R.
