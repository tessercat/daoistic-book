天之道。

不戰
而善勝。

不言
而善應。

弗召
而自來。

戰
而善謀。

天罔恢恢。

而不失。

## English

The adventurous get slaughtered,
the unadventurous stay safe.

Some are helped by this,
some are harmed.

Who knows what provokes the wrath of God?

The universal way

isn't warlike,
but it's overpowering,

isn't demanding,
but it's very convincing,

doesn't summon us,
but comes in person,

makes war,
but very cunningly.

God casts a wide net.

It's loose,
but it doesn't miss.
