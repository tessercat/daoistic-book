是以聖人猶難之 is in received but not in mwdb.
Mwba is missing this section,
no Guodian.

Mwbb uses 單 twice in this chapter.
The first reference is missing in mwba,
but mwba uses 彈 in the second reference.

Received use 爭 for the first reference,
and 繟然 for the second.

Mwbb uses 單 in 67, but the passage is missing in all others.
Mwbb uses 單 in 68 where mwba and received use 戰.

Mwba 彈 could mean something like
accuse, denounce,
but once you've chosen 戰, the poem makes sense as a whole,
how to fight.
