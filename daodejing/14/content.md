## Hanzi

視之而弗見
名之曰夷

聽之而弗聞
名之曰希

搏之而弗得
名之曰微

三者不可至計
故混而為一

一者其上不，
其下不忽

繩繩呵不可名也
復歸於無物
是謂無狀之狀

無物之象
是謂忽望

迎之而不見其首
隨之而不見其後

執今之道
以御今之有
以知古始

是謂道紀

## English

Looking for it but not finding it,
they say it's obscure.

Listening for it but not not hearing it,
they say it's imminent.

Reaching for it but not getting it,
they say it's elusive.

These three, they're inconclusive,
so mix them together as one.

That one, promoting it doesn't prove it
and rejecting it doesn't refute it.

So vast it's immeasurable,
dwindling to nothing at all,
they call that a description of the indescribable.

Thinking about nothing at all,
they call that refusing to believe.

Welcome it without seeing its face,
follow along without seeing its back.

Stay on today's road
by navigating today's reality
by learning the lessons of the past.

They call that Daoji, rules of the road.
