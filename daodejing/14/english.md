Looking for it but not finding it,
they say it's obscure.

Listening for it but not not hearing it,
they say it's imminent.

Reaching for it but not getting it,
they say it's elusive.

These three, they're inconclusive,
so mix them together as one.

That one, promoting it doesn't prove it
and rejecting it doesn't refute it.

So vast it's immeasurable,
dwindling to nothing at all,
they call that a description of the indescribable.

Thinking about nothing at all,
they call that refusing to believe.

Welcome it without seeing its face,
follow along without seeing its back.

Stay on today's road
by navigating today's reality
by learning the lessons of the past.

They call that Daoji, rules of the road.
