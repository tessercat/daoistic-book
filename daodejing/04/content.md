## Hanzi

道沖
而用之
有弗盈也。

淵呵若萬物之宗，
銼其銳，
解其紛，
和其光，
同其塵。

湛呵若或存，
吾不知其誰之子也，
象帝之先。

## English

Dao is an empty pot,
but using it
doesn't seem to fill it.

As deep as the past,
it questions our faith,
answers our questions,
tempers our passion,
mixes our dust.

As wide as the future,
it's the child of who knows what,
parent of Xiangdi, saints of old.
