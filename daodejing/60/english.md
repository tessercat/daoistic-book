Running a big country
is like cooking little fish.

When the world is on the right track,
the dead don't come back to haunt us.

Not only do the dead not haunt us,
the gods don't punish anyone.

Not only do gods not punish anyone,
the wise don't punish anyone either.

When two sides stop punishing each other,
a moral relationship returns to them.
