治大國
若亨小鮮。

以道立天下，
其鬼不神。

非其鬼不神也，
其神不傷人也，

非其神不傷人也，
聖人亦弗傷也。

夫兩不相傷，
故德交歸焉。

## English

Running a big country
is like cooking little fish.

When the world is on the right track,
the dead don't come back to haunt us.

Not only do the dead not haunt us,
the gods don't punish anyone.

Not only do gods not punish anyone,
the wise don't punish anyone either.

When two sides stop punishing each other,
a moral relationship returns to them.
