# Gratitude

## Hanzi

人之飢也，
以其上食稅之多也，
是以飢。

百姓之不治也，
以其上有以為也，
是以不治。

民之輕死，
以其求生之厚也，
是以輕死。

夫唯無以生為者，
是賢於貴生。

## English

People are hungry.
Their leaders tax them too much,
so they starve.

Workers are upset.
Their leaders have opinions,
so they're disorganized.

People ignore death.
They're desperate to make the most of life,
so they scoff at death.

Only those who don't take life for granted
are truly capable of caring for life.
