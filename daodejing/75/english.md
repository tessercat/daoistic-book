People are hungry.
Their leaders tax them too much,
so they starve.

Workers are upset.
Their leaders have opinions,
so they're disorganized.

People ignore death.
They're desperate to make the most of life,
so they scoff at death.

Only those who don't take life for granted
are truly capable of caring for life.
