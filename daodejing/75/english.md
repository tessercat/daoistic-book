Peasants starve
when taxes are too high.
That's why they're starving.

Workers get upset
when the boss gets involved.
That's why they're disorganized.

People risk death
when they want life to reward them.
That's why they're willing to die.

Only those who expect nothing of life
are truly capable of appreciating life.
