This poem
has a lot of variation
between versions,
and the details
are anyone's guess,
but in general,
it's pretty clearly about
what good leaders don't do
when they're trying to get people
to work together on something,
and then,
some advice
on what to do instead.

The advice
contains the famous
characters for
raw silk and plain wood
as virtues to appreciate and protect,
and contrasts them
with self-interest and desire
as vices to minimize and reject.
