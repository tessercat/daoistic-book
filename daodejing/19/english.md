Stop encouraging them,
don't motivate them,
people would do a hundred times more.

Stop cheating them,
don't exploit them,
crime wouldn't exist.

Stop forcing them,
don't threaten them,
people would cooperate.

You might think these three sayings
aren't very well organized,
so order them to get in line.

Make it plain,
keep it simple,
be less needy,
don't be greedy.
