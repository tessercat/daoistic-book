Stop explaining it to them and don't argue with them
and people would be a hundred times better off.

Stop lying to them and don't exploit them
and there would be no rebels and thieves.

Stop forcing them and don't threaten them
and people would start helping again.

You might think these three sayings
aren't very good advice,
but you set the standard.

Keep it simple,
stay natural,
swallow your pride,
check your privilege.
