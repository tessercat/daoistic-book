Stop supervising them,
don't train them,
people would produce a hundred times more.

Stop cheating them,
don't exploit them,
there'd be no rebels or thieves.

Stop threatening them,
don't force them,
people would start helping again.

You might think these three sayings
aren't very helpful,
so order them to get in line.

Keep it simple,
stay natural,
swallow your pride,
check your privilege.
