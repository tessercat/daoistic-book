Stop explaining it to them,
don't argue with them,
people would be a hundred times better off.

Stop lying to them,
don't exploit them,
there would be no traitors and thieves.

Stop forcing them,
don't threaten them,
people would start helping again.

You might think these three sayings
aren't very good advice,
but you set the standard.

Keep it simple,
stay natural,
swallow your pride,
check your privilege.
