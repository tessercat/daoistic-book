# Obedience

## Hanzi

故曰為道者，
非以明民也，
將以愚之也，
民之難治也，以其知也。
故以知國，國之賊也，
以不知國，國之德也。

恆知此兩者亦稽式也。
恆知稽式此謂玄德。
玄德深矣，
遠矣，
與物反矣，
乃至大順。

## English

Since they say follow the way
not by enlightening people,
but by keeping them in the dark,
people are hard to govern when they're aware.
Because when they notice government, they're against it,
when they don't notice government, they're for it.

Those who always keep this in mind just have to follow the signs.
Always knowing how to follow signs means Xuande, deep morality.
When deep morality is ingrained,
pervasive,
lets others disagree,
there's perfect harmony.
