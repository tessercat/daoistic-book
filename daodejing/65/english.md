Since they say follow the way
not by enlightening people,
but by keeping them in the dark,
people are hard to govern when they're aware.
Because when they notice government, they're against it,
when they don't notice government, they're for it.

Those who always keep this in mind just have to follow the signs.
Always knowing how to follow signs means Xuande, deep morality.
When deep morality is ingrained,
pervasive,
lets others disagree,
there's perfect harmony.
