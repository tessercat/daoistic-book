# Sovereignty

## Hanzi

重為輕根，
[清靜]為躁君，
是以君子[眾冬終]日行，
不[離遠]其輜重。

[唯雖]有[環官|榮觀]，
燕處[則昭若][超然]。
[若奈]何萬乘之[王主]，
而以身輕於天下？

輕則失本，
躁則失君。

## English

Responsibility trumps taking it easy,
patience has authority over anger,
so in the everyday business of governing,
don't shrink from the burden of responsibility.

When you have a solemn duty,
relaxing means keeping things in perspective.
How can you command ten-thousand chariots,
and be comfortable in public life?

Taking it easy means losing legitimacy,
getting angry means losing authority.
