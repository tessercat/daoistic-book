Responsibility trumps taking it easy,
patience has authority over anger,
so in the everyday business of governing,
don't shrink from the burden of responsibility.

When you have a solemn duty,
relaxing means keeping things in perspective.
How can you command ten-thousand chariots,
and be comfortable in public life?

Taking it easy means losing legitimacy,
getting angry means losing authority.
