The philosophy of the _Daodejing_
is very conservative.
Stability is all.

"Civilized" is 不遠徙.
The phrase appears only a few times in ctext,
but I think it refers to settled people,
but phrased in the negative.
We are _not_ nomadic wanderers.

I like the implicit threat of
the two middle sayings.
Leaders who try to impose "progress" by force
should expect violent reaction
from a healthy, settled society.

"Old ways" is 結繩.
The term refers to
a pre-literate method of using knotted cords
to keep track of (probably tax) obligations.

"Invading" is 往來.
It literally means
"come and go"
or "to and fro",
and again refers to
the unsettled wandering
that should be avoided
in the Doaist utopia.
The Chinese term definitely doesn't have
the same meaning of violent assault
as "invade" in English,
though etymology is similar.
"Visiting" would probably be
a more accurate interpretation,
but,
given the references to war chariots
and armor and weapons,
I can't resist.
