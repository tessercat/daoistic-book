Stability is all.

"Civilized" is 不遠徙.
The phrase appears
only a few times in ctext,
but I think it refers to settled people,
but phrased in the negative.
We are _not_ nomadic wanderers.

I like the implicit threat of
the two middle sayings.
Leaders who try
to impose "progress" by force
should expect violent reaction
from a healthy, settled society.

"Old ways" is 結繩.
The term refers to
a pre-literate method
of using knotted cords
to keep track of
(probably tax) obligations.

"Invading" is 往來.
It literally means
"come and go"
or "to and fro",
and again refers to
the unsettled wandering
that should be avoided
in the Doaist utopia.
The Chinese term
definitely doesn't have
the same meaning of violent assault
as "invade" in English,
but given the references to
to war chariots
and armor and weapons,
I can't resist.
