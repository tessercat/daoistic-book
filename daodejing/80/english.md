A small town, a few people.

Order them to produce ten times more,
but they'll just ignore you.

Threaten them with consequences,
but they're civilized.

They have war chariots
they don't take anywhere.

They have armor and weapons
they don't show off.

Give them back their plumb lines
and take them as they are.

Their food is delicious,
their clothing is beautiful,
their homes are peaceful,
their lives are happy.

Neighbouring towns
are within sight of each other.

Their chickens and dogs
can hear one another.

People live out their lives
without invading each other.
