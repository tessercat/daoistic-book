# Utopia

## Hanzi

小國寡民

使有什伯之器
而勿用

使民重死
而不遠徙

雖有周車
無所乘之

雖有甲兵
無所陳之

使民復結繩
而用之

甘其食
美其服
安其居
樂其俗

鄰國
相望

雞犬之聲
相聞

民至老死
不相往來

## English

A small town, a few people.

Give them tools that do the work of ten,
but they won't use them.

Threaten them with consequences,
but they're civilized.

They have war chariots
they don't take anywhere.

They have armor and weapons
they don't show off.

Give them back their plumb lines
and take them as they are.

Their food is delicious,
their clothing is beautiful,
their homes are peaceful,
their parties are fun.

Neighbouring towns
are within sight of each other.

Their chickens and dogs
can hear one another.

People live out their lives
without invading each other.
