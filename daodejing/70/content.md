## Hanzi

吾言甚易知也，
甚易行也，
而天下莫之能知也，
而莫之能行也。

言有宗，
事有君。

夫唯無知也，
是以不我知。

知者希，
則我貴矣。

是以聖人被褐而褱玉。

## English

Our words are very easy to understand,
very easy to apply,
but no one in politics can understand them,
and no one can apply them.

The words have a tradition,
the work has a master.

Above all their lack of awareness
means they don't know me.

If the aware are rare,
I must be valuable.

So the wise wear plain clothes and cover jade.
