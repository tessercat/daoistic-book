Our orders are very easy to understand,
very easy to follow,
but it's impossible for people to understand them,
impossible to follow them.

The orders are ancient,
the mission is just,
and above all, unknowable,
so we don't reveal them.

They less they know,
they more they respect us,
so the wise
wear plain clothes
and conceal jade.
