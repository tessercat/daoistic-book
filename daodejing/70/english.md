Our words are very easy to understand,
very easy to apply,
but no one in politics can understand them,
and no one can apply them.

The words have a tradition,
the work has a master.

Above all their lack of awareness
means they don't know me.

If the aware are rare,
I must be valuable.

So the wise wear plain clothes and cover jade.
