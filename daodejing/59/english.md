Govern people to serve God,
there's nothing like hard times.

After all,
hardship
means making do.

Making do
means saving up.

If we save up,
nothing's impossible.

If nothing's impossible,
no one knows our fate.

Not knowing our fate
could mean leading a nation.

The principles of leading nations
could mean it lasts a long time.

This one's called,
Strong fundamentals,
healthy relationships,
the Dao of a long and healthy life.
