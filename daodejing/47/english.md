Don’t step out the door
to understand the world.

Don’t look out the window
to understand the universe.

Stepping outside is even more isolating,
understanding is even more humbling.

So the wise
don’t go anywhere but understand,
aren't understood but have a good reputation,
don’t do anything but get things done.
