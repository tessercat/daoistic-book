Don’t step out the door
to understand the world.

Don’t peer through a telescope
to understand the universe.

Stepping outside is even more isolating,
understanding is even more humbling.

So the wise
don’t go anywhere but understand,
aren't understood but have a good reputation,
don’t do anything but get things done.
