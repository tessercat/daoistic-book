## Hanzi

不出於戶
以知天下。

不窺於牖
以知天道。

其出也彌遠，
其知也彌少。

是以聖人
不行而知，
不知而名，
弗為而成。

## English

Don’t step out the door
to understand the world.

Don’t look out the window
to understand the universe.

Stepping outside is even more isolating,
understanding is even more humbling.

So the wise
don’t go anywhere but understand,
aren't understood but have a good reputation,
don’t do anything but get things done.
