The best are like water.

Water helps everything
and doesn't fight.

Follow its example
by turning the other cheek.

Good instincts are steady,
good minds are open,
good hearts are kind,
good words are honest,
good decisions are fair,
good plans are practical,
good actions are timely.

Above all, not fighting
means not holding grudges.
