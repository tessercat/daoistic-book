The best are like water.

Water helps everything
and doesn't fight.

Follow its example
by turning the other cheek.

A good home is stable,
a good mind is open,
a good gift is thoughtful,
a good saying is true,
a good decision is fair,
a good plan is practical,
a good move is timely.

Above all, not fighting
means not holding grudges.
