The best are like water.

Water helps everything
and doesn't fight.

Follow its example
by turning the other cheek.

Good habits are steady,
good minds are open,
good gifts are kind,
good words are honest,
good rules are fair,
good work is useful,
good action is timely.

Above all, not fighting
means not holding grudges.
