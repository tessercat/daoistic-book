## English

The best are like water.

Water is good at helping everything
and doesn't argue.

It puts up with everyone's crap
because it embodies Dao.

The earth is good at settling down,
the calm are good at thinking,
the kind are good at giving,
the sincere are good at communicating,
the organized are good at leading,
the capable are good at helping,
the seasons are good at changing.

Above all they don't argue
because they don't object to anything.
