Apostles of the open heart
are devoted only to the road.

Others on the road,
only to faith,
only to doubt.

Between doubt and faith,
there's reason.

Between faith and doubt,
there's reality.

Between staying quiet and speaking up,
there's a calling.

Within a truly worthy calling,
there's commitment.

Till now from days of old,
our movement hasn't faltered
by remembering founding fathers.

How do I know
what the founding father were like?

Like this.
