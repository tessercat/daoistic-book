孔德之客
唯道是從。

道之物
唯望
唯忽。

忽呵望呵，
中有象呵。

望呵忽呵，
中有物呵。

幽呵鳴呵，
中有請也。

其請甚真，
其中有信。

自今及古，
其名不去，
以閱眾父。

吾何以知
眾父之然？

以此。

## English

Apostles of the open heart
are devoted only to the road.

Others on the road,
only to faith,
only to doubt.

Between doubt and faith,
there's reason.

Between faith and doubt,
there's reality.

Between staying quiet and speaking up,
there's a calling.

Within a truly worthy calling,
there's commitment.

Till now from days of old,
our movement hasn't faltered
by remembering founding fathers.

How do I know
what the founding father were like?

Like this.
