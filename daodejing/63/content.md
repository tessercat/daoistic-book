## Hanzi

為無為，
事無事，
味無味。

大小，
多少，
報怨以德。

圖難乎其易也，
為大乎其細也。

天下之難作於易，
天下之大作於細。

是以聖人終不為大，
故能成其大。

夫輕諾
必寡信。

多易
必多難。

是以聖人猶難之，
故終於無難。

## English

Practice doing nothing,
try striving for nothing,
savour the taste of nothing.

Big or small,
major or minor,
face challenges with character.

Plan hard jobs as easy ones,
do big jobs as little ones.

Hardship comes from taking it easy,
greatness comes from humility.

So the wise end up not doing big jobs
so they can get big jobs done.

An easy promise
is always an empty promise.

Taking it too easy
always makes things too hard.

So the wise scold them gently
and they end up having no trouble at all.
