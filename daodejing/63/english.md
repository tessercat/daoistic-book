Practice doing nothing,
try striving for nothing,
savour the taste of nothing.

Big or small,
many or few,
face conflict with character.

Plan hard jobs as easy ones,
make big things from little ones.

Hardship comes from taking it easy,
greatness come from humility.

That's why the wise
never think big,
so they can do great things.

An easy promise is an empty promise,
taking it too easy makes it a lot harder.

That's when the wise
are hard on them,
so nothing is ever difficult.
