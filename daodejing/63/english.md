Practice doing nothing,
try striving for nothing,
savour the taste of nothing.

Big or small,
major or minor,
face challenges with character.

Plan hard jobs as easy ones,
do big jobs as little ones.

Hardship comes from taking it easy,
greatness comes from humility.

So the wise end up not doing big jobs
so they can get big jobs done.

An easy promise
is always an empty promise.

Taking it too easy
always makes things too hard.

So the wise scold them gently
and they end up having no trouble at all.
