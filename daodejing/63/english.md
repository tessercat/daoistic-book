Govern without an agenda,
delegate without getting involved,
decide without being in control.

Whether crimes are big or small,
whether sins are many or few,
settle disputes fairly.

Think of conflict as cooperation,
use power with humility.

Society's conflicts are always about sharing,
society's power is always about synergy.

So the wise resolve not to abuse our power
so we can do great things together.

Easy promises are always empty promises,
more sharing always causes more conflict.

So the wise hold us accountable
so we settle it ourselves without fighting.
