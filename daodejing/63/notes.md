This interpretation
is nothing like
the "accepted" version.
難 and 易
are usually translated
as something like
hard and easy,
and the poem is normally about
the importance of doing things
a little at a time. 

But 難 and 易
can also mean
conflict and exchange,
and since it's easier for me
to reconcile other features
of the poem with this
non-standard interpretation
of these two key characters,
my version is about
why conflict happens
and how to resolve it,
or better yet,
how to avoid it
in the first place.

Note that
since I've taken this poem
as a fairly extreme statement
of libertarian economics,
I've also taken the liberty of changing
味無味 to 知無知
to make a stronger statement
about the importance of the ruler
getting out of the way,
and Cook's Guodian footnotes
indicate that this change
isn't completely outside the realm of possibility.
He notes in particular that
[Wenzi 道原 4](https://ctext.org/wenzi/dao-yuan#n58493)
contains a variation
that ends with 知不知.
In for a penny,
in for a pound.

Cook's footnotes
also point out the considerable debate
regarding the interpretation of 大小 and 多少.
If you search ctext
for passages containing
[both terms](https://ctext.org/pre-qin-and-han?searchu=大小%20多少),
the discussion is about justice,
and if you search for
[報怨](https://ctext.org/pre-qin-and-han?searchu=報怨),
the debate is about how to respond to
the problem of criminal justice,
with 直 or 德.

[猶難](https://ctext.org/pre-qin-and-han?searchu=猶難),
also appears in ctext,
including twice in the Daodejing.
(See also
[chapter 77](https://daodejing.ca/studies/73 "Study chapter 77")).
According to Kroll,
both can mean something like blame,
and in context,
they look something like "punishment" to me,
or at least an ominous warning.
