The hanzi is mostly based on Wangbi,
but I've added particles from Guodian,
and I've imported few characters
from Mawangdui (故曰 and 能).

This poem is in two parts in Guodian,
so it's possible that this was originally
two different poems,
with the split following
the tree/tower/journey sayings.
(Guodian contains two versions
of the second half of the poem,
the only redundancy found in Guodian.)

The sayings before the tree/tower/journey sayings,
are very pithy and rhymey,
and I've tried to reproduce
their pithiness and rhyminess
with alliteration.
I think it works quite well,
and I don't think
I've lost much of the plot,
if any.

"This big around,"
is literally 合抱,
so tiny sprouts end up
an arm's embrace around.
Nice,
but I don't know
how to make that work in English,
and I like the idea of gestures
that go along with the sayings.

In Guodian,
the tree/tower/journey sayings
all imply upward motion.
The tree grows,
the tower rises,
and the person climbs a hundred steps
instead of travelling a thousand 里.
I've kept the more traditional saying
for the sake of familiarity,
and I've changed the literal,
"Starts from beneath your feet,"
(始於足下)
to, "Starts with a single step,"
simply because people are used to it
and I think it sounds better.

Note that the first 為/敗 couplet
in the second section of the poem
also appears in
[chapter 29](https://daoistic.ca/studies/29 "Read chapter 29"),
but I've interpreted it very differently there,
and much less literally.
