It's stable and easy to sustain,
predictable and easy to plan,
fragile and easily shattered,
skittish and easily scattered.

Handle it before it happens,
fix it before it falls apart.

A tree this big around
grew from a tiny sprout.

A tower nine stories high
rose from a pile of dirt.

A journey of a thousand miles
starts with a single step.

Running things ruins them,
holding on chases them away,
so the wise don't do anything
so they don't ruin anything,
and don't have anything
so they don't lose anything.

When there's work to do,
people often fail just as they're about to succeed,
so they tell us
to be as careful at the end
as we were at the beginning
so we don't waste any effort.

So the wise try not to want anything,
and they don't appreciate the finer things.

They learn not to conform
and they ignore what everyone else says
so they can affirm everything’s true nature
and they wouldn't dare tell us what to do.
