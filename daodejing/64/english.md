It's calm and easy to control,
uncertain and easy to plan.
fragile and easily broken,
small and easy to lose.

Practice before it happens,
organize before it gets out of hand.

A tree of many arms around
grows from a tiny sprout.

A tower of nine stories
rises from a pile of dirt.

A journey of a thousand miles
starts from beneath your feet.

Practicing means failing,
keeping means losing.

So the wise don't fail because they don't do anything,
don't lose anything because they don't keep anything.

People fail,
and they always fail just as they're about to succeed.

That's why when you're
as cautious at the end as you were at the beginning,
you won't fail to get it done.

So the wise

try not to expect anything
and don't appreciate the finer things,

learn not to learn
and return to what everyone else rejects.

So they can affirm everythingâ€™s true nature,
and they wouldn't dare manage them.
