其安也易持也
其未兆也易謀也
其脆也易破也
其微也易散也

為之於未有
治之於未亂

合抱之木
作於毫末

九成之臺
作於纍土

千里之行
始於足下

為之者敗之
執之者失之

聖人無為故無敗也
無執故無失也

人之敗也
恆於其且成也敗之

故
慎終若始
則無敗事矣

是以聖人

欲不欲
而不貴難得之貨

學不學
而復眾之所過

是以能輔萬物之自然
而弗敢為。

## English

It's calm and easy to control,
uncertain and easy to plan.
fragile and easily broken,
small and easy to lose.

Practice before it happens,
organize before it gets out of hand.

A tree of many arms around
grows from a tiny sprout.

A tower of nine stories
rises from a pile of dirt.

A journey of a thousand miles
starts from beneath your feet.

Practicing means failing,
keeping means losing.

So the wise don't fail because they don't do anything,
don't lose anything because they don't keep anything.

People fail,
and they always fail just as they're about to succeed.

That's why when you're
as cautious at the end as you were at the beginning,
you won't fail to get it done.

So the wise

try not to expect anything
and don't appreciate the finer things,

learn not to learn
and return to what everyone else rejects.

So they can affirm everything’s true nature,
and they wouldn't dare manage them.
