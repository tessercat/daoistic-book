Observe the mind,
focus,
allow no distractions.

Concentrate the breath,
soften,
allow innocence.

Practice letting go,
deepen reflection,
allow no criticism.

Love humanity,
contemplate community,
allow no prejudice.

Cosmic gates open and close,
allow acceptance.

Aware of everything,
allow no thought.

It gives us life,
nurtures us,
creates but doesn't keep us,
leads but doesn't rule us.

They call it Xuande, deeply moral.
