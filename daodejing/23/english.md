Brevity is natural.

Strong winds don't last the morning,
heavy rain doesn't last the day.

What does that mean?

Even heaven and earth
can't last forever.

How are people any different?

So devoted servants of Dao
stick to the road,
the moral stick to morality,
skeptics stick to doubt.

To the moral,
the road is good to you too.

To the skeptics,
the road doesn't believe in you either.
