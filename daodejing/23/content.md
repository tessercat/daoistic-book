# Skepticism

## Hanzi

希言自然。

飄風不終朝，
驟雨不終日。

孰為此？

天地，
而弗能久。

有況於人乎？

故從事於道者
同於道，
德者同於德，
失者同於失。

同於德者，
道亦德之。

同於失者，
道亦失之。

## English

Brevity is natural.

Strong winds don't last the morning,
heavy rain doesn't last the day.

What does that mean?

Even heaven and earth
can't last forever.

How are people any different?

So devoted servants of Dao
stick to the road,
the moral stick to morality,
skeptics stick to doubt.

To the moral,
the road is good to you too.

To the skeptics,
the road doesn't believe in you either.
