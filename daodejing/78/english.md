Nothing about politics
is meek and mild like water,
but to chasten pride and power,
nothing beats it
because it's impossible to ignore.

The meek do it to master the strong,
the mild do it to convince the stubborn.

No one in politics is unaware of it
but no one can apply it.

Since the words of the wise tell us that

taking society's crap
is what it means to be
a knight of the realm,

[receiving the country's misfortune]
is what it means to be
king of the world,

the right words seem wrong.
