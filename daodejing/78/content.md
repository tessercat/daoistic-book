天下莫
柔弱於水，
而攻堅強者，
莫之能勝也，
以其無以易之也，

弱之勝強也，
柔之勝剛也。

天下莫弗知也，
而莫能行也。

故聖人之言云

受國之垢，
是謂
社稷之主，

受國之不祥，
是謂
天下之王，

正言若反。

## English

Nothing about politics
is meek and mild like water,
but to chasten pride and power,
nothing beats it
because it's impossible to ignore.

The meek do it to master the strong,
the mild do it to convince the stubborn.

No one in politics is unaware of it
but no one can apply it.

Since the words of the wise tell us that

taking society's crap
is what it means to be
a knight of the realm,

[receiving the country's misfortune]
is what it means to be
king of the world,

the right words seem wrong.
