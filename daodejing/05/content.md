# Neutrality

## Hanzi

天地不仁，
以萬物為芻狗。

聖人不仁，
以百省為芻狗。

天地之間，
其猶橐籥乎？

虛而不屈，
動而愈出。

多言數窮，
不如守中。

## English

Heaven and earth aren't humane.
They treat everything as straw dogs.

The wise aren't humane.
They treat clan chiefs as straw dogs.

Between heaven and earth,
isn't it like a bellows?

Empty, but it doesn't collapse.
Pump and more comes out.

Lecturing and criticizing
aren't the same as staying neutral.
