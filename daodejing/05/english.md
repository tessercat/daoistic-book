Heaven and earth aren't humane.
They treat everything as straw dogs.

The wise aren't humane.
They treat clan chiefs as straw dogs.

Between heaven and earth,
isn't it like a bellows?

Empty, but it doesn't collapse.
Pump and more comes out.

Lecturing and criticizing
aren't the same as staying neutral.
