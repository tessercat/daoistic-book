Heaven and earth aren't humane.
They treat everything as straw dogs.

The wise aren't humane.
They treat citizens as straw dogs.

Between heaven and earth,
isn't it like a bellows?

Empty, but it doesn't collapse.
Squeeze and more comes out.

Barking orders, placing blame,
that's not the same as staying neutral.
