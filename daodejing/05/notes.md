百姓 is literally the hundred clans.
Here,
and in 17, 49 and 75,
百姓 is citizens.

According to Kroll,
a possible reading of 數窮
is to enumerate faults,
and the phrase appears in Wenzi and Lushi Chunchiu
as something bosses do to servants:
數窮於下.
I think it's something like
finding fault with subordinates,
blaming and berating them.

多言 also appears
in a few places in ctext
as something that people do
and regret immediately.
I think it's something like
lecturing and 'splaining
and generally being a pompous ass.
