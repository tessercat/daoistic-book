Standing on tip-toes isn't stable,
going too far isn't progress.

Proving it doesn't make it obvious,
explaining it doesn't make it clear,
bragging about it is pointless,
praising it doesn't make it last.

On the road,
they say that nature abhors wasted energy and extra effort,
and that's why following the road means not insisting.
