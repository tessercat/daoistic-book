# Discipline

## Hanzi

企者不立，
跨者不行。

自視者不彰，
自見者不明，
自伐者無功，
自矜者不長。

其在道也
曰餘食贅行，物或惡之
故有道者弗居。

## English

Standing on tip-toes isn't stable,
going too far isn't progress.

Proving it doesn't make it obvious,
explaining it doesn't make it clear,
bragging about it is pointless,
praising it doesn't make it last.

On the road,
they say that nature abhors wasted energy and extra effort,
and that's why following the road means not insisting.
