The strong give in and go with the flow,
the world's bitch.

In the world's love affairs,
the female always dominates the male by seducing him,
and to be seductive,
it helps to be submissive.

When the strong give in to the weak,
they dominate the weak.
When the weak give in to the strong,
they take from the strong.
So sometimes give in to dominate,
and sometimes give in but receive.

So the strong don't pass up an opportunity to unite and shepherd others,
and the weak don't pass up an opportunity to join and follow others.

For everyone to get what they want,
it helps when the strong are humble.
