# Inferiority

## Hanzi

大國者下流也
天下之牝。

天下之交也，
牝恆以靚勝牡，
為其靚也，
故宜為下。

大國以下小國，
則取小國。
小國以下大國，
則取於大國。
故或下以取，
或下而取。

故大國者不過欲兼畜人，
小國者不過欲入事人。

夫皆得其欲
則大者宜為下。

## English

The strong give in and go with the flow,
the world's bitch.

In the world's love affairs,
the female always dominates the male by seducing him,
and to be seductive,
it helps to be submissive.

When the strong give in to the weak,
they dominate the weak.
When the weak give in to the strong,
they take from the strong.
So sometimes give in to dominate,
and sometimes give in but receive.

So the strong don't pass up an opportunity to unite and shepherd others,
and the weak don't pass up an opportunity to join and follow others.

For everyone to get what they want,
it helps when the strong are humble.
