Wise politicians never think for themselves.
They let citizens think for them.

We treat good ones well
and we treat bad ones well too.

Character is decency.

We trust honest ones
and we trust dishonest ones too.

Character is honesty.

The role of the wise
is to bring people together,
to get people to cooperate.

Citizens always want to fit in.

The wise always make room for them.
