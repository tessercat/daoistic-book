The wise never have anything in mind,
they take everyone's heart to heart.

They treat good people well,
they treat bad people well,
character is decency.

They trust honest people,
they trust dishonest people,
character is trust.

The role of the wise in the world
is to get to know them,
to be the world's mixed-up heart.

Everyone always wants to know how they fit in,
the wise always make room for them.
