Wise politicians never think for themselves.
They let citizens do the thinking for them.

The good ones treat us well
and the bad ones also treat us well.
Character is dignity.

The honest ones trust us
and the dishonest ones trust us too.
Character is honesty.

The role of the wise
is to bring people together,
to get people in sync.

Citizens always want to fit in.
The wise always make room for them.
