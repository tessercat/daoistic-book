Wise politicians never think for themselves.
They let citizens do the thinking for them.

They get along with the good ones
as well as they get along with the bad ones.
Character is good will.

They trust the honest ones
as much as they trust the dishonest ones.
Character is faith.

The role of the wise
is to bring people together,
to get people in sync.

Citizens always want to fit in.
The wise always make room for them.
