Wise politicians never think for themselves.
They let citizens think for them.

They get along with saints
and they get along with sinners.

Character has respect.

They trust the believers
and they trust the skeptics.

Character has faith.

The role of the wise
is to bring people together,
to get people to cooperate.

Citizens always want to know how they fit in.
The wise always make room for them.
