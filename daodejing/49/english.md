Wise politicians never think for themselves.
They let citizens think for them.

They respect the good ones,
but they also respect the bad ones.

Character is respect.

They trust the honest ones,
but they also trust the dishonest ones.

Character is trust.

The role of the wise
is to bring people together,
to get people to cooperate.

Citizens always want to fit in.

The wise always make room for them.
