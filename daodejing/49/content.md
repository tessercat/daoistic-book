# Consideration

## Hanzi

聖人恆無心，
以百姓之心為心。

善者善之，
不善者亦善之，
德善也。

信者信之，
不信者亦信之，
德信也。

聖人之在天下，
歙歙焉，
為天下渾心。

百姓皆屬耳目焉，
聖人皆咳之。

## English

The wise never have anything in mind,
they take everyone's heart to heart.

They treat good people well,
they treat bad people well,
character is decency.

They trust honest people,
they trust dishonest people,
character is trust.

The role of the wise in the world
is to get to know them,
to be the world's mixed-up heart.

Everyone always wants to know how they fit in,
the wise always make room for them.
