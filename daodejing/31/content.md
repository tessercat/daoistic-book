# Remembrance

## Hanzi

君子居則貴左，
用兵則貴右。

故曰兵者，
非君子之器也。

不得已而用之，
銛襲為上。

弗美也。

美之，
是樂殺人。

夫樂殺人，
不可以得志於天下。

故吉事上左，
喪事上右，
偏將軍居左，
上將軍居右。

言以喪禮居之也，
殺人之眾，則以哀悲泣之，
戰勝，則以喪禮居之。

## English

In diplomacy, honour the treaty,
at war, honour the alliance.

They say soldiers
aren't very diplomatic.

When there's no option but to use them,
overwhelming force works best.

Don't glorify them.

Glorifying them
is really celebrating murder.

Taking pleasure in killing people
won't get you far in the world.

Since they say that festivals favour the east,
and funerals favour the west,
seat the conquered on the right,
seat the victor on the left.

Hold a service in remembrance,
mourn the dead in sadness and sorrow,
hold a wake for victory in war.
