In diplomacy, honour the treaty,
at war, honour the alliance.

They say soldiers
aren't very diplomatic.

When there's no option but to use them,
overwhelming force works best.

Don't glorify them.

Glorifying them
is really celebrating murder.

Taking pleasure in killing people
won't get you far in the world.

Since they say that festivals favour the east,
and funerals favour the west,
seat the conquered on the right,
seat the victor on the left.

Hold a service in remembrance,
mourn the dead in sadness and sorrow,
hold a wake for victory in war.
