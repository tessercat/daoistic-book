Honour or life,
which is more important?

Health or money,
which is more valuable?

Winning or losing,
which is more trouble?

True love is so expensive
and a huge fortune is so much to lose.

Being content and not being ashamed,
and knowing when to quit and not taking risks
are what it takes to make them grow and last.
