## Hanzi

執大象，
天下往，
往而不害。

安平大，
樂與餌，
過客止。

故道之出言也，
曰淡呵，
其無味也。

視之不足見，
聽之不足聞，
而不可既也。

## English

In an ideal world,
kingdoms rise,
rise and never fall.

Peace and prosperity,
parties and potstickers,
mission accomplished.

So the road speaks up,
says, So boring,
that's not interesting at all.

It's not worth looking at,
it's not worth listening to,
and can never come to be.
