# Persistence

## Hanzi

天下有始
以為天下母

既知其母
復知其子
既知其子
復守其母
沒身不殆

塞其兌閉其門
終身不勤

開其兌濟其事
終身不救

見小
曰明
守柔
曰強

用其光
復歸其明
無遺身殃

是謂習常

## English

Society exists for a reason.
Think of it as society's mother.

When you recognize the mother,
go back and think about her children,
and when you understand her children,
go back and protect the mother,
and you'll never be in danger.

Close the shutters and bar the gate
and you won't worry about anything.

Open the shutters and support the cause
and you won't save anyone.

Looking out for the weak
is called enlightenment,
and protecting the vulnerable
is strength.

Shine her light
and return once again to her wisdom
and you won't get left behind.

This one's called Xichang, regular exercise.
