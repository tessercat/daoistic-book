Society exists for a reason.
Think of it as society's mother.

When you recognize the mother,
go back and think about her children,
and when you understand her children,
go back and protect the mother,
and you'll never be in danger.

Close the shutters and bar the gate
and you won't worry about anything.

Open the shutters and support the cause
and you won't save anyone.

Looking out for the weak
is called enlightenment,
and protecting the vulnerable
is strength.

Shine her light
and return once again to her wisdom
and you won't get left behind.

This one's called Xichang, regular exercise.
