Society exists for a reason.
Think of it as society's mother.

When you recognize the mother,
you'll understand her children,
and when you understand her children,
you'll protect them from the mother,
but you'll never be in danger.

You'll shutter the windows and bar the gate
but you won't worry about anything.

You'll open the shutters and support the cause,
but you won't save anyone.

Looking after for the weak
is called wisdom,
and protecting the vulnerable
is called strength.

Shine the light,
you'll go back to the wisdom
but you won't get left behind.

This one's called Xichang, practice makes perfect.
