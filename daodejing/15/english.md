In the old days,
good leaders must have been
quietly curious,
deeply intelligent,
ultimately inscrutable,
so loud sing their praise.

Cautious, like they were crossing a river in winter.

Scared, like they were surrounded by hostile neighbours.

As brave as apostles,
as chill as ice,
as true as timber,
as messy as mud.

Who can clean up by calming down,
and who can hold steady by changing?

Those who took this path
didn't ask for perfection.

Above all, accepting imperfection
meant they could make mistakes
and not start from scratch.
