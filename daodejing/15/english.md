In the old days,
good leaders must have been
quietly curious,
deeply intelligent,
ultimately inscrutable,
so loud sing their praise.

As cautious as winter travellers,
as anxious as worried neighbours,
as polite as guests.

As chill as ice,
as true as timber,
as messy as mud.

Who can clean up by settling down,
and who can be stable by changing?

Those of us who practice this method
don't try to perfect it.

Above all, we don't perfect it
so we can neglect it
and not start from scratch.
