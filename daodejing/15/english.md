In the old days,
good leaders must have been
quietly curious,
deeply intelligent,
ultimately inscrutable,
so loud sing their praise.

As cautious as winter travellers,
as anxious as worried neighbours,
as brave as refugees.

As chill as ice,
as true as timber,
as messy as mud.

Who among us can slowly clean up by calming down,
and slowly create stability by changing?

Those of us who embrace this method
don't want to fill up
so we can save up
but not start from scratch.
