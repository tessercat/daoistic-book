In the old days,
good leaders must have been
quietly curious,
deeply intelligent,
ultimately inscrutable,
so loud sing their praise.

As cautious as a winter crossing,
as diplomatic as a dangerous neighbourhood.

As brave as apostles,
as chill as ice,
as true as timber,
as messy as mud.

Didn't they clean up by calming down,
and didn't they hold steady by changing?

Those who preserve their ways
aren't prefectionists.

Above all, imperfection
means something can be flawed
and not have to be rebuilt.
