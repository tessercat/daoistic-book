In the old days,
good leaders must have been
quietly curious,
deeply intelligent,
ultimately inscrutable,
so loud sing their praise.

As cautious as a winter crossing,
as diplomatic as a dangerous neighbourhood.

As brave as apostles,
as chill as ice,
as true as timber,
as messy as mud.

What lets filth, in stillness, slowly settle,
what lets balance, through movement, slowly arise?

Those who preserve their ways
aren't perfectionists.

Above all, they don't finish
so they can make mistakes
and not have to start from scratch.
