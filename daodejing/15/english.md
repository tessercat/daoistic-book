In the old days,
good leaders must have been
quietly curious,
deeply intelligent,
ultimately inscrutable,
so loud sing their praise.

As cautious as a winter crossing,
as diplomatic as a dangerous neighbourhood.

As brave as apostles,
as chill as ice,
as true as timber,
as messy as mud.

As meltwater always clears very slowly in stillness,
as patterns always emerge very slowly when it moves?

Those of us who preserve their ways
aren't perfectionists.

Above all, imperfection
means we can fail
and not start from scratch.
