In the old days,
good leaders must have been
quietly curious,
deeply intelligent,
ultimately inscrutable,
so loud sing their praise.

As cautious as a winter crossing,
as diplomatic as a dangerous neighbourhood.

As polite as guests,
as chill as ice,
as true as timber,
as messy as mud.

Didn't they clean up by calming down,
and didn't they hold steady by changing?

Those of us who preserve their ways
don't try to master them.

Above all, not mastering them
means we can stray from them
and not have to reinvent them.
