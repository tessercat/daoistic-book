In the old days,
good leaders must have been
quietly curious,
deeply intelligent,
ultimately inscrutable,
so loud sing their praise.

As cautious as a winter crossing,
as faithful as a trusted friend,
as respectful as a guest.

As chill as ice,
as true as timber,
as mixed up as melt water.

Who else could let melt water,
by stillness,
slowly settle?

Who else could let peace,
by movement,
slowly arise?

Those who took this path
didn't want to fill up
so they could save up
and not start from scratch.
