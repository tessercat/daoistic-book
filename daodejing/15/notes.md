As [homogenous] as [turbulent/muddy water].

Don't use 眇 for 妙, this is MWD-ony thing. Guodian uses 妙.

I have no idea what to make of 達 and 通.  Their most common shared meaning seems to be something like "open", though they also both have the sense of something like unconventional. However, both imply something like penetrating below the surface of things, something like intuition? Introspective? Introverted?

不可志 as unpretentious (MWDA) goes nicely with loud sing their praise, but 深不可識 as unfathomable works pretty well, especially with deeply for 深.

豫與 can both mean participate, take part in, but what does that have to do with a fording a river in winter? 豫 can mean take precautions, which makes more sense to me, but 與 doesn't seem to have that meaning.

猶 and 猷 both can have the same meaning, 1) plan scheme, design, draw up, project 2) method means principle, but what does that have to do with 畏四鄰, respecting the neighbors?

嚴and 儼 of R both mean dignified, which goes nicely with ambassador for客, but 敢 of G goes nicely with pilgrim/apostle/traveler/outsider for 客. I have no idea what to make of R using 容 where WMD and G use 客.

[保葆服]此道者. The first character varies as 保 in G and R, and 葆 in MWD. I think this might be an attempt at a pun, because 葆 means "take" as in "take this road" but can mean hidden/concealed. 保 doesn't have that meaning, but could with a stretch. Perhaps 保 in R is a simplification that preserves the pun, somewhat. Wenzi and Huinanzi both use the more obvious 服 for "take this road".

I'm not sure what to make of 尚 in G's 不欲尚盈. There are no examples of 欲尚 or 尚盈 in ctext, or even of 欲上 or 上盈  (尚 and 上 seem to be synonyms) that can help make sense of this.

蔽 and 敝 both have the meaning of cover, conceal, protect, hide, which fits with the opening theme of obscurity, and this fits with the theme of the poem. Wenzi and Huinanzi both use 弊, with the same meaning. 蔽 and 敝 both have the meaning of destroy, which makes sense in opposition to 不(新)成, but 蔽 used in R, does not have this meaning.

The second half of the punchline is missing from G, not sure why. All R use 不新成, including Wenzi and Huinanzi, not 不成 as in MWD.

文子 九守 守弱 2 and 淮南子 道應訓 54 both use 不新成. Wenzi uses it in reference to a water clock that tips over when it's full and is upright when it empties.
