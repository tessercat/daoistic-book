On the watery virtues
of anonymous saints of old.

As in
chapter 8,
they took people's shit,
decontaminated themselves
in quiet solitude
and took action
only to restore balance.

I'm finding it very difficult
to find words in English
to express the ç›ˆ saying succinctly.

I think it's a saying
for those of us who inherited
the mess left to us
by those who came before.
It's a reminder that
we'll never perfect it,
never finish it,
but that's OK,
because that's what lasts.
Everything good
is flexible
and it adapts,
but only to restore balance.
It's flawed and incomplete,
and it's not modern,
not perfect,
never shiny and new.
