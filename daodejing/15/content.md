## Hanzi

古之
善為士者必
微妙，
玄達，
深不可識，
是以為之頌。

與呵其若冬涉川，
猶呵其若畏四鄰，
儼呵其若客。

渙呵其若釋，
敦呵其若樸，
混呵其若濁。

孰能濁，
以靜者，
將徐清。

孰能安，
以動者，
將徐生。

保此道者
不欲盈
是以能蔽
而不新成。

## English

In the old days,
good leaders must have been
quietly curious,
deeply intelligent,
ultimately inscrutable,
so loud sing their praise.

As cautious as a winter crossing,
as faithful as a trusted friend,
as respectful as a guest.

As chill as ice,
as true as timber,
as mixed up as melt water.

Who else could let melt water,
by stillness,
slowly settle?

Who else could let peace,
by movement,
slowly arise?

Those who took this path
didn't want to fill up
so they could save up
and not start from scratch.
