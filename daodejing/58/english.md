When reform is moderate, the people are willing,
when reform is sweeping, the system is broken.

Success depends on failure,
disaster hides in luck,
who knows what fate has in store?

When there's nothing to fix,
reform comes back as unintended consequences,
good intentions come back as problems.
To change people's minds,
keep calm and carry on.

so be consistent and don't give up,
be fair and don't provoke,
be firm but don't shackle,
light the way but don't shine.
