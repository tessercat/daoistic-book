# Leading the Way

## Hanzi

其正閔閔，其民屯屯，
其正察察，其政缺缺。

禍福之所倚，
福禍之所伏，
孰知其極。

其無正，
正復為奇，
善復為訞，
人之悉也
其日固久矣。

是以方而不割，
兼而不刺，
直而不紲，
光而不眺。

## English

When reform is moderate, the people are willing,
when reform is sweeping, the system is broken.

Success depends on failure,
disaster hides in luck,
who knows what fate has in store?

When there's nothing to fix,
reform comes back as unintended consequences,
good intentions come back as problems.
To change people's minds,
keep calm and carry on.

so be consistent and don't give up,
be fair and don't provoke,
be firm but don't shackle,
light the way but don't shine.
