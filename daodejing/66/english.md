They say rivers and seas
rule a hundred valleys.

Letting themselves be low
lets them be king.

The wise lead others
by reporting to them in person.

They have authority over others
by submitting to their command.

Their authority
doesn't oppress anyone.

Their leadership
doesn't hurt anyone.

The world is happy to oblige
and doesn't resent them.

By not competing,
they're beyond compare.
