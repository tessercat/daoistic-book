The universal way is like an archer
who pulls down the top,
lifts up the bottom,
releases when there's plenty,
draws when there's not enough.

Since the universal way
takes the extra
and puts it where there's not enough,
the human way is unnatural
because it takes from the poor
and serves the rich.

How can we have plenty
and share what the universe offers?

Only by following the way.

So the wise take but don't keep it,
build but don't stay there,
and don't expect to get credit for it.
