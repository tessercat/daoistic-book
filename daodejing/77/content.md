# Virtue

## Hanzi

天之道猶張弓者也，
高者抑之，
下者舉之，
有餘者損之，
不足者益之。

故天之道
損有餘
而益不足，
人之道則不然
損不足
而奉有餘。

孰能有餘
而有以取奉於天者乎。

唯有道者乎。

是以聖人為而弗有，
成功而弗居也，
其不欲見賢也。

## English

The universal way is like an archer
who pulls down the top,
lifts up the bottom,
releases when there's plenty,
draws when there's not enough.

Since the universal way
takes the extra
and puts it where there's not enough,
the human way is unnatural
because it takes from the poor
and serves the rich.

How can we have plenty
and share what the universe offers?

Only by following the way.

So the wise take but don't keep it,
build but don't stay there,
and don't expect to get credit for it.
