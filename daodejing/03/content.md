# Government

## Hanzi

不上賢使民
不爭。

不貴難得之貨使民
不為盜。

不見可欲使民
不亂。

是以聖人之治也，
虛其心，
實其腹，
弱其志，
強其骨。

恆使民
無知，
無欲也。

使夫
知不敢，
弗為，
而已。

則無不治矣。

## English

People who aren't ambitious
don't fight.

People who don't appreciate the finer things
don't become thieves.

People who don't have dreams
don't make trouble.

So the government of the wise
empties their minds,
settles their bellies,
weakens their will,
strengthens their bone.

Then people
don't suspect anything,
don't expect anything.

Then leaders
know not to interfere,
not to allow it,
and nothing more.

Then we don't mess anything up.
