I take this poem
as a statement of
extreme libertarianism.
The government of the wise
isn't a meritocracy,
it doesn't make people rich,
and it doesn't make promises.
It leaves people alone
and it doesn't do anything
so it doesn't screw anything up.
The positive influence of government
fills bellies and strengthens bones
and that's it.

My version
diverges from Wangbi near the end,
and I follow Mawangdui B instead.
There's not much difference in substance,
but I think it works better in English.
