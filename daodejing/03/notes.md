I take this poem
as a statement of
extreme libertarianism.
The government of the wise
isn't a meritocracy,
it doesn't hoard treasure,
and it doesn't make promises.
It leaves people alone
and it doesn't do anything
so it doesn't screw anything up.
The positive influence of government
fills bellies and strengthens bones
and that's it.

My version
diverges from Wangbi near the end,
and I follow Mawangdui B instead.
