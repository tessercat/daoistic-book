People who aren't ambitious
don't fight.

People who don't appreciate the finer things
don't become thieves.

People who don't have dreams
don't make trouble.

So the government of the wise
empties their minds,
settles their bellies,
weakens their will,
strengthens their bone.

Then people
don't suspect anything,
don't expect anything.

Then leaders
know not to interfere,
not to allow it,
and nothing more.

Then we don't mess anything up.
