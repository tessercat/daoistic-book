民不畏威，
則大威至矣。

無狎其所居，
無厭其所生，
夫唯弗厭，
是以不厭。

是以聖人自知
而不自見也。

自愛
而不自貴也。

故去罷
取此。

## English

When people don't fear your power,
you've become truly powerful.

Without getting complacent,
without getting angry,
above all don't get angry
so you're not angry.

So the wise are self-aware,
but not self-centred.

They have self-respect,
but they're not self-entitled.

So let go of weariness,
hold on to this.
