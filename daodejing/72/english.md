When people don't fear your power,
you've become truly powerful.

Without getting complacent,
without getting angry,
above all don't get angry
so you're not angry.

So the wise are self-aware,
but not self-centred.

They have self-respect,
but they're not self-entitled.

So let go of weariness,
hold on to this.
