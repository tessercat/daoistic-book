# Decency

## Hanzi

和大怨，
必有餘怨。

安可以為善。

是以聖人執左芥，
而不以責於人。

故有德司芥，
無德司徹，
天道，
無親，
恆與善人。

## English

Making peace with the enemy,
hatred always lingers.

Patience is a virtue.

So the wise honour their obligations
and don't impose them on others.

Since character honours the deal,
and lack of character honours its due,
the universal way,
without caring,
is always with the virtuous.
