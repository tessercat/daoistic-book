上士聞道，
勤能行於其中。

中士聞道，
若存若亡。

下士聞道，
大笑之。

弗大笑，
不足以為道矣。

是以建言有之，
明道如悖，
夷道如纇，
進道如退。

上德如谷，
大白如辱，
廣德如不足，
建德如偷，
質真如渝。

大方無隅，
大器晚成，
大音希聲，
大象無形。

夫唯道善
貸且善成。

## English

When good leaders are shown the way,
hard work lets them walk right down the middle.

When average leaders are shown the way,
some create, some destroy.

When poor leaders are shown the way,
they laugh at it.

If they didn't laugh at it,
it wouldn't be worth thinking of as Dao.

So to set it down in words,
the right way seems wrong,
the easy way seems hard,
the way forward might be a step back.

The highly moral seem vain,
the deeply humble seem arrogant,
liberal values seem worthless,
conservative values seem corrupt,
absolute truth might be fickle.

The great square has no corners,
great potential develops slowly,
the good word is rarely heard,
the grand plan is never revealed.

Above all, Dao is good
at both forgiving and reconciling.
