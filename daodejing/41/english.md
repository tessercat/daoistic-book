When good leaders are shown the way,
hard work lets them walk right down the middle.

When average leaders are shown the way,
some create, some destroy.

When poor leaders are shown the way,
they laugh at it.

If they didn't laugh at it,
it wouldn't be worth thinking of as Dao.

So to set it down in words,
the right way seems wrong,
the easy way seems hard,
the way forward might be a step back.

The highly moral seem vain,
the deeply humble seem arrogant,
liberal values seem worthless,
conservative values seem corrupt,
absolute truth might be fickle.

The great square has no corners,
great potential develops slowly,
the good word is rarely heard,
the grand plan is never revealed.

Above all, Dao is good
at both forgiving and reconciling.
