When good leaders hear about Dao,
it's hard, but they walk
right down the middle.

When average leaders hear about it,
some create, some destroy.

When poor leaders hear about it,
they laugh at it.

If it wasn't funny,
it wouldn't be Dao.

That's why we have these sayings.

The right way seems wrong,
the easy way seems hard,
the way forward might be a step back.

The highly moral seem vain,
the deeply humble seem arrogant.

Liberal values seem worthless,
conservative values seem corrupt.

Absolute truth might be fickle.

Time and space are infinite,
great potential develops slowly,
the good word is rarely heard,
the grand plan is never revealed.

Dao hides in the nameless,
and above all
Dao is good
at both forgiving and reconciling.
