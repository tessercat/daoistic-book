Understanding it means not talking about it,
talking about it means not understanding it.

Close the shutters,
bar the gate,
dim the light,
stir the ash,
dull the edge,
loosen the knot.

They call it Xuantong, deep ambivalence,
because you can't get it and care,
and you can't get it and forget,
you can't get it and get ahead,
and you can't get it and get hurt,
you can't get it and get respect
and you can't get it and hate
because you treat the world with respect.
