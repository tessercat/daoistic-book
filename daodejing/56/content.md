## Hanzi

知之者弗言。
言之者弗知。

閉其兌，
塞其悶，
和其獷，
同其塵，
畜其銳，
解其紛。

是謂玄同，
故不可得而親，
亦不可得而疏，
不可得而利，
亦不可得而害，
不可得而貴，
亦不可得而賤，
故為天下貴。

## English

Understanding it means not talking about it,
talking about it means not understanding it.

Close the shutters,
bar the gate,
dim the light,
stir the ash,
dull the edge,
loosen the knot.

They call it Xuantong, deep ambivalence,
because you can't get it and care,
and you can't get it and forget,
you can't get it and get ahead,
and you can't get it and get hurt,
you can't get it and get respect
and you can't get it and hate
because you treat the world with respect.
