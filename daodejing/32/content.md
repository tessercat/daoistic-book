# Rivers and Seas

## Hanzi

道恆無名。

樸，雖細，
天地弗敢臣。

侯王若能守之，
萬物將自賓。

天地相合也，
以輸甘露。

民莫之令
而自均焉。

始制有名。

名亦既有，
夫亦將知止，

知止所以不殆。

譬道之在天下也，
猶小谷之與江海。

## English

Dao never says anything.

Though nature is humble,
heaven and earth wouldn't dare tell it what to do.

If lords and kings could remember that,
everyone would behave themselves.

The communion of heaven and earth
gives us our daily bread.

People have no say in it,
but adapt themselves to it instead.

Start writing when there's something to say.

As soon as there's something to say,
you'll know how it ends.

Knowing how it ends gives it integrity.

Civilization is to Dao
as a gutter to rivers and seas.
