Dao never says anything.

Though nature is humble,
heaven and earth wouldn't dare tell it what to do.

If lords and kings could remember that,
everyone would behave themselves.

The communion of heaven and earth
gives us our daily bread.

People have no say in it,
but adapt themselves to it instead.

Start writing when there's something to say.

As soon as there's something to say,
you'll know how it ends.

Knowing how it ends gives it integrity.

Civilization is to Dao
as a gutter to rivers and seas.
