# Autonomy

## Hanzi

道恆無為。

侯王若能守之，
萬物將自化，
化而欲作。

吾將正之
以無名之樸。

夫亦將知，
知足以靜。

萬物將自定。

## English

Dao never does anything.

If lords and kings could remember that,
everything would turn itself around,
turn around and want to help out.

We'd get it right
in the spontaneity of the wordless.

We'd also know
how to be satisfied with peace.

Everything would work itself out.
