## Hanzi

道者萬物之注也，
善人之保也，
不善人之所保也。

美言可以市，
尊行可以加人，

人之不善也，
何棄之有？

故立天子，
置三卿，
雖有共之璧以先四馬，
不若坐而進此。

古之所以貴此者何也？

不謂
求以得，
有罪以免輿？

故為天下貴。

## English

Everything follows to the road.
Honest people treasure it.
Dishonest people take refuge in it.

Pretty words might be flattery,
good deeds might be favours.

The lies people tell,
who can deny they exist?

That's why the throne of the Child of Heaven,
or being anointed as one of the Three Lords,
or just serving as Jade of Honour by leading the Four Mares,
isn't as important as sitting and contemplating this.

But why did the ancients want those things?

Didn't they say,
Ask and ye shall receive,
sin and ye shall be forgiven?

That's what made the world want them.
