Everything follows to the road.
Honest people treasure it.
Dishonest people take refuge in it.

Pretty words might be flattery,
good deeds might be favours.

The lies people tell,
who can deny they exist?

That's why the throne of the Child of Heaven,
or being anointed as one of the Three Lords,
or just serving as Jade of Honour by leading the Four Mares,
isn't as important as sitting and contemplating this.

But why did the ancients want those things?

Didn't they say,
Ask and ye shall receive,
sin and ye shall be forgiven?

That's what made the world want them.
