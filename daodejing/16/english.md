Become completely empty,
stay perfectly still.

Everything that makes progress,
I watch it fall back.

Living creatures blossom and bloom,
every one of us turns back to dust.

So says stillness.

Stillness,
they call it a progress report.

Progress reports are factual,
facing facts is enlightenment.

Denying facts is delusion,
delusion is dangerous.

Patiently facing facts,
patience leads to tolerance,
tolerance leads to balance,
balance leads to harmony,
harmony leads to the way,
the way leads to selfless integrity.
