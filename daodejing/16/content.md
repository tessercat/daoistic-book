# Integrity

## Hanzi

至虛極也，
守靜篤也。

萬物並作，
吾以觀其復也。

天物芸芸，
各復歸於其根。

曰靜。

靜，
是謂復命。

復命常也，
知常明也。

不知常妄，
妄作凶。

知常容，
容乃公，
公乃王，
王乃天，
天乃道，
道乃沒身不殆。

## English

Become completely empty,
stay perfectly still.

Everything that makes progress,
I watch it fall back.

Living creatures blossom and bloom,
every one of us turns back to dust.

So says stillness.

Stillness,
they call it a progress report.

Progress reports are factual,
facing facts is enlightenment.

Denying facts is delusion,
delusion is dangerous.

Patiently facing facts,
patience leads to tolerance,
tolerance leads to balance,
balance leads to harmony,
harmony leads to the way,
the way leads to selfless integrity.
