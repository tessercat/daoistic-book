When people are either obedient
or don't fear death,
why execute and terrorize them?

When people are told either to obey
or to face death
and they do something wrong,
when you give the order to arrest and execute them,
who would dare?

When people must either obey
or face certain death,
appoint an executioner
and execute anyone who interferes.

In reality, they're interfering with
the master carpenter's blade,
and anyone who gets in the way of
the master carpenter's blade
rarely doesn't cut their hands.
