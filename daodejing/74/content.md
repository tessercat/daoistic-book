# Punishment

## Hanzi

若民恆
且不畏死，
奈何以殺懼之也？

若使民恆
且畏死
而為畸者，
吾將得而殺之，
夫孰敢矣？

若民恆
且必畏死，
恆有司殺者，
夫伐司殺者殺。

是伐
大匠斲也，
夫伐
大匠斲者
希不傷其手矣。

## English

When people are either obedient
or don't fear death,
why execute and terrorize them?

When people are told either to obey
or to face death
and they do something wrong,
when you give the order to arrest and execute them,
who would dare?

When people must either obey
or face certain death,
appoint an executioner
and execute anyone who interferes.

In reality, they're interfering with
the master carpenter's blade,
and anyone who gets in the way of
the master carpenter's blade
rarely doesn't cut their hands.
