# Principles

## Hanzi

道生一，
一生二，
二生三，
三生萬物。

萬物負陰
而抱陽，
沖氣以為和。

人之所惡，
惟孤，
寡，
不穀，
而王公
以為稱
故物或損之而益，
或益之而損。

人之所教，
我亦教之，
強梁者不得其死。

吾將以為教父。

## English

Dao creates unity,
unity creates duality,
duality creates trinity,
trinity creates everything.

Everything is repelled by Yin, the negative,
and is attracted to Yang, the positive,
channels Qi, energy, to stay balanced.

People shun them,
the lonely orphan,
the forsaken,
the undeserving,
but kings and princes
took them as namesakes
because some things harm us but help,
some help us but harm.

Others teach it,
and we teach it too,
that tyrants don't live out their days.

I take this as my creed.
