Dao creates unity,
unity creates duality,
duality creates trinity,
trinity creates everything.

Everything is repelled by Yin, the negative,
and is attracted to Yang, the positive,
channels Qi, energy, to stay balanced.

People shun them,
the lonely orphan,
the forsaken,
the undeserving,
but kings and princes
took them as namesakes
because some things harm us but help,
some help us but harm.

Others teach it,
and we teach it too,
that tyrants don't live out their days.

I take this as my creed.
