The fish out of water
is a common saying
in the literature of the time,
and the vulnerability
of even the mightiest of whales
to the smallest of insects,
and what this means to leaders,
is addressed in detail in

My interpretation of the passage can be found at
[At the Mercy of Ants](/blog/ants-part-1 "Read At the Mercy of Ants - Part 1").
