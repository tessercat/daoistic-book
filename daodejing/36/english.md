When you try to control them,
you'll end up unleashing them.

When you try to weaken them,
you'll end up strengthening them.

When you try to crush them,
you'll end up inspiring them.

When you try to beat them,
you'll end up joining them.

They call that
a glimmer of enlightenment.

The meek
conquer the mighty.

The whale
mustn't leave the deep.

The power of the state
can't be used
to show people the way.
