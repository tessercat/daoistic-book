Trying to control them
just provokes them.

Trying to weaken them
just strengthens them.

Trying to hurt them
just helps them.

Trying to divide them
just unites them.

They call that
a glimmer of enlightenment.

The meek
conquer the mighty.

The whale
mustn't leave the deep.

The power of the state
can't be used
to show people the way.
