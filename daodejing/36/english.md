Trying to control them
ends up empowering them.

Trying to weaken them
ends up strengthening them.

Trying to hurt them
ends up helping them.

Trying to divide them
ends up uniting them.

They call that
a glimmer of enlightenment.

The meek
conquer the mighty.

The whale
mustn't leave the deep.

The power of the state
can't be used
to show people the way.
