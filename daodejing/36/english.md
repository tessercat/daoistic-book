Trying to control them
just provokes them.

Trying to weaken them
just strengthens them.

Trying to hurt them
helps them.

Trying to divide them
unites them.

They call that
a glimmer of enlightenment.

The meek
conquer the mighty.

The whale
mustn't leave the deep.

The power of the state
can't be used
to show people the way.
