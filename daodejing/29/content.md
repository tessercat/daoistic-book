# Extremism

## Hanzi

將欲取天下而為之。

吾見其弗得已。

天下神器也。

非可為者也。

為者敗之，
執者失之。

物或行或隨，
或炅或坐，
或坏或墮。

是以聖人
去甚，
去大，
去奢。

## English

Everybody wants to change the world.

I say it changes no matter what we do.

Legitimacy.

That's not something you can change.

Progressives are defeated by it,
conservatives lose it.

They're either too far ahead or too far behind,
too radical or too reactionary,
too cruel or too corrupt.

So the wise
reject too much,
too big,
too extreme.
