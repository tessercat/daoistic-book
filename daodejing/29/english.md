Everybody wants to change the world.

I say it changes no matter what we do.

Legitimacy.

That's not something we can change.

Progressives are defeated by it,
conservatives lose it.

They're either too far ahead or too far behind,
too radical or too reactionary,
too cruel or too corrupt.

So the wise
reject too much,
too big,
too extreme.
