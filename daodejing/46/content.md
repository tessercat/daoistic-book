天下有道
卻走馬以糞

天下無道
戎馬生於郊

罪莫厚於甚欲
咎莫憯於欲得
禍莫大於不知足

知足之為足
此恆足矣

## English

The world is on the right track
when old pack horses are put out to pasture.

The world has lost its way
when war horses breed in the fields.

There's no sin more deadly than ambition,
no fate more tragic than a dream come true,
nothing more painful than never being satisfied.

Be thankful for having enough,
that's always enough.
