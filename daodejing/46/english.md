The world is on the right track
when old pack horses graze the pasture.

The world has lost its way
when war horses breed in the fields.

There's no sin more deadly than greed,
no fate more tragic than a dream come true,
nothing more painful than never being satisfied.

Be thankful for having enough,
that's always enough.
