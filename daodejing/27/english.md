Good explorers don't follow trails,
good communicators don't criticize,
good fortune-tellers don't use yarrow stalks.

A good defense doesn't bar the gate
but can't be breached.

A good alliance doesn't sign a treaty
but can't be broken.

So the wise are good at helping others,
and no one is expendable,
there's no wasted potential.

They call it passing the torch.

Since good people are good at being good people,
and bad people learn from good people,

not respecting the master,
not pitying the apprentice,
might seem smart,
but they're huge mistakes.

They say it's essential but subtle.
