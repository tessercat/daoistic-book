# Subtlety

## Hanzi

善行者無[勶達轍]迹，
善言者無瑕[適讁]，
善數者不[以用][檮篿籌]策。

善閉者無關[籥楗]
而不可[啟開]也。

善結者無[纆繩]約
而不可解也。

是以聖人[恆常]善救人，
而無棄人，
物無棄財。

是謂[申曳襲]明。

故善人善人之師，
不善人善人之[齎資]也。

不貴其師，
不愛其[齎資]。
雖智
大[眯迷]。

是謂要妙。

## English

Good explorers don't follow trails,
good communicators don't criticize,
good fortune-tellers don't use yarrow stalks.

A good defense doesn't bar the gate
but can't be breached.

A good alliance doesn't sign a treaty
but can't be broken.

So the wise are good at helping others,
and no one is expendable,
there's no wasted potential.

They call it passing the torch.

Since good people are good at being good people,
and bad people learn from good people,

not respecting the master,
not pitying the apprentice,
might seem smart,
but they're huge mistakes.

They say it's essential but subtle.
