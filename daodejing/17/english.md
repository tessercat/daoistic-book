It's best when they only know they have one.

It's less than ideal
when they're devoted to you,
admire you,
worse still when they respect you,
even worse when they're your friends.

When you don't trust them enough,
expect mistrust,
and deprive yourself of their expertise.

Just do your job and do it well
so everyone says,
I'll do that too.
