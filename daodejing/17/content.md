## Hanzi

太上下知有之

其次親譽之
其次畏之
其次侮之

信不足
案有不信

悠呵其貴言也

功成事遂
百姓皆謂
我自然也

## English

At first, your subordinates know they have one.

Then they flatter you,
then they fear you,
then they make fun of you.

They're not very trusting,
and you should expect disrespect.

Preaching is pointless.

Just do the job and do it well
so the chiefs can all say
they did it themselves.
