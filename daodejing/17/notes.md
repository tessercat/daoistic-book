This chapter and the next
appear in Guodian
as the same poem.

This explains 故
at the beginning of chapter 18,
and brings some clarity to 有,
used in both parts of the poem
to indicate
the kind of behaviour
that good leaders
accept and don't require
of subordinates (下)
and citizens (百姓).

The poem is one statement
among many
in the _Dao De Jing_
of the natural tendency
of people
to resent and reject authority,
and that the best authority
is a moral authority
that people don't even notice,
let alone question.
