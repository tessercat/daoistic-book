There was something uniform and perfect
before the creation of heaven and earth.

In silent stillness,
in unchanging solitude,
think of it as society's mother.

No one knows how to describe it.

I call it Dao.

If you ask me to describe it,
I'll call it great.

Greatness,
I call that mortality.

Mortality,
I call that separation.

Separation,
I call that revolution.

The heavens are great,
the earth is great,
Dao is great,
and kings are great too.

The greatness of the middle realm is four-fold,
and kings are part of but one.

Humanity is to the earth,
as the earth is to the universe,
as the the universe is to Dao,
as Dao is to what is.
