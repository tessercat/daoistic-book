Privilege is as dangerous as punishment,
virtue is as personal as suffering.

What were they saying
about privilege and punishment?

Privilege is a put down.

When getting it was trouble
and forgetting it was trouble,
they were right to say
that privilege and punishment are dangerous.

Why did they say
that virtue is as personal as suffering?

It's painful to me
when I take it personally.

When I don't take it personally,
why should I care?

That's why my virtue takes it personally
when I'm responsible for society,

and my compassion takes it personally
when I'm committed to society.
