人之生也柔弱，
其死也堅強。

萬物草木之生也柔脆，
其死也枯槁。

故堅強者死之徒也，
柔弱者生之徒也，
是以兵強則不勝，
木強則恆。

強大居下，
柔弱居上。

## English

A newborn babe, soft and weak,
is tough and stubborn in the end.

Every new life, soft and tender,
withers and rots in the end.

Since hard and strong describe death
and soft and weak describe life,
strong armies don't win,
hard timber splits.

Size and strength are liabilities,
the small and weak have the upper hand.
