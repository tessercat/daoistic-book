A newborn babe, soft and weak,
is stiff and stubborn in the end.

Every new life, soft and tender,
withers and rots in the end.

Since hard and strong describe death
and soft and weak describe life,
strong armies don't win,
hard timber splits.

Size and strength are liabilities,
the small and weak have the upper hand.
