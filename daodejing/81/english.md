Honesty isn't flattering,
flattery isn't honest.

Certainty isn't tolerant,
tolerance isn't sure.

Doing good doesn't do a lot,
doing a lot doesn't do any good.

The wise don't have a lot.

By considering others,
they have more for themselves.

By giving to others,
they do a lot more for themselves.

The universal way
helps and doesn't harm.

The way of the wise
follows along and doesn't struggle against it.
