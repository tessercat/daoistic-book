# Impermanence

## Hanzi

含德之厚者
比於赤子。

蜂蠆虺蛇
弗螫。

攫鳥猛獸
弗搏。

骨弱筋柔
而捉固。

未知牝牡之合
而朘怒，
精之至也。

終日號
而不嗄，
和之至也。

和
曰常。

知和
曰明。

益生
曰祥。

心使氣
曰強。

物壯
則老。

是謂
不道。

不道早已。

## English

The truly powerful
are like newborn babes.

Wasps, scorpions and snakes
don't sting them.

Birds of prey and savage beasts
don't attack them.

Delicate bones, soft muscles,
but a firm grip.

Unaware of the union of female and male,
but shrinking and growing
in perfect innocence.

Howling all day,
but no worse for wear,
in perfect harmony.

Harmony,
that's persistence.

Noticing harmony,
that's enlightenment.

Promoting life,
that's grace.

A beating heart,
that's power.

When they grow up
they get old.

They call that
Budao, not Dao.

Budao is temporary.
