The truly powerful
are like newborn babes.

Scorpions
don't sting them.

Predators
don't snatch them.

Delicate bones, soft muscles,
but a firm grip.

Ignorant of the facts of life,
but shrinking and growing
in perfect innocence.

Singing all day,
but not straining,
in perfect harmony.

Harmony,
that's persistence.

Noticing harmony,
that's enlightenment.

Promoting life,
that's grace.

A beating heart,
that's power.

When we grow up,
we get old
and they say we're out of touch.

Out of touch
and out of time.
