The truly powerful
are like newborn babes.

Scorpions and snakes
don't poison them.

Birds and beasts of prey
don't attack them.

Delicate bones, soft muscles,
but a firm grip.

Ignorant of the facts of life,
but shrinking and growing
in perfect innocence.

Singing all day,
but not straining,
in perfect harmony.

Harmony,
that's persistence.

Noticing harmony,
that's enlightenment.

Promoting life,
that's grace.

A beating heart,
that's power.

When we grow up,
we get old
and they call us obsolete,
obsolete and fading fast.
