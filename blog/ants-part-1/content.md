# At the Mercy of Ants - Part 1

The old guy used to say that
a beached whale is at the mercy of ants,
and the prince who forgets his place
and tells ministers what to do
is at the mercy of bureaucrats.

The prince stays on top
by doing nothing.
He knows his place
and builds trust
by listening closely.
Ministers hide their authority
and don’t conspire against him.
Instead,
they control the boss by doing their job.

When a prince
doesn’t trust the experts
and has ideas of his own,
his authority erodes every day
and he has only himself to blame.
Meddling makes it impossible to get good advice,
and mingling makes it impossible to stay in charge.
When his authority no longer inspires obedience,
and his power no longer commands respect,
there’s no way for him to influence subordinates.

When righteous anger forms in his heart,
when he plays favourites in public,
those who once knew their place
stop doing the right thing
and start pandering to superiors.
When bureaucrats break the rules
and do as they please,
when they’re not rewarded for merit,
not held accountable for corruption,
that’s when high and low
work against each other.

When prince and ministers hate each other,
when the cabinet is in chaos
and he can't impose order,
when accusations are made
and he can't judge fairly,
when the accused are wronged
and he can't hold them to account,
that’s when the master is weak
and servants are lazy.

So those who would guide
the great craftsman’s blade
rarely don’t cut their hands.
