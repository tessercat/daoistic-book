# At the Mercy of Ants - Part 1

Laozi used to say
that a beached whale
is at the mercy of ants,
and the prince who forgets his place and does a servant's work
is at the mercy of bureaucrats.
老子曰
鯨魚失水
則制於螻蟻
人君舍其所守
而與臣爭事則制於有司

A prince keeps his throne by doing nothing.
He knows his place and builds trust by listening closely.
Ministers and subordinates respect his judgement and don't question it.
Instead, they hold superiors accountable by serving them.
以無為持位
守職者以聽從取容
臣下藏智而不用
反以事專其上

When a prince doesn't trust experts and likes getting involved,
his judgement gets worse every day and he has only himself to blame.
He's not being reasonable when he vents his frustration on subordinates,
and he can't be in charge when he steps down from the throne.
When his judgement no longer inspires obedience
and his position no longer commands respect,
there's no way for him to influence subordinates.
人君者不任能而好自為
則智日困而自負責
數窮於下則不能申理
行墮於位則不能持制
智不足以為治
威不足以行刑
則無以與下交矣

When he takes every whim and slight to heart,
when he plays favourites in public,
those who once knew their place stop doing the right thing and start pandering to superiors.
When public servants break the law and serve themselves,
when they're not rewarded for merit,
not held accountable for corruption,
that's when ruler and ruled take grudges to heart.
喜怒形於心
嗜欲見於外
則守職者離正而阿上
有司枉法而從風
賞不當功
誅不應罪
則上下乖心

When the prince and his servants resent each other,
when his team is in chaos and no one trusts his judgement,
when problems arise and no one follows his orders,
when he makes mistakes and blames others instead,
that's when the master is weak and servants are lazy.
君臣相怨
百官煩亂而智不能解
非譽萌生而明不能照
非己之失而反自責
則人主愈勞人臣愈佚

So those who reach for the great craftsman's blade
rarely don't cut their hands.
是以代大匠斲者
希有不傷其手
