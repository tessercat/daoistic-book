老子曰
鯨魚失水
則制於螻蟻

人君舍其所守
而與臣爭事
則制於有司

The old guy used to say that
a beached whale
is at the mercy of ants.

A prince who forgets his place
and tries to do his minister's work
is at the mercy of [有司 bureaucrats].

以無為持位

守職者
以聽從取容

臣下藏智
而不用

反
以事專其上

A prince maintains his authority by doing nothing.

He knows his place
and builds trust by listening closely.

Ministers [下藏智 conceal their power]
and don't manipulate him.

Instead,
they control the boss by doing their job.

人君者
不任能
而好自為
則智日困
而自負責

數窮於下
則不能申理

行墮於位
則不能持制

智不足以為治
威不足以行刑
則無以與下交矣

When a prince
doesn't trust experts
and prefers to do it himself,
his [智困 power erodes] every day
and he has only himself to blame.

[數窮 Talking down to] subordinates
makes it impossible [申理 to communicate],

and [行墮 interference from authority]
makes it impossible to [持制 maintain control].

If he's not [智 powerful] enough to [為治 make them obey],
not [威ruthless] enough to [行刑 make them pay],
there's no way for him to influence his subordinates.

喜怒形於心
嗜欲見於外
則守職者
離正
而阿上

有司枉法
而從風
賞不當功
誅不應罪
則上下乖心

With joy and anger in their hearts,
with envy and ambition on their sleeves,
those who once knew their place
stop doing the right thing
and start pandering to their superiors.

When [有司 bureaucrats] ignore the law
and [從風 follow the wind],
when they're not rewarded for merit,
not punished for crime,
that's when high and low [乖心 are at each other's throats].

君臣相怨

百官煩亂
而智不能解

非譽萌生
而明不能照

非己之失
而反自責

則人主愈勞
人臣愈佚

When prince and ministers hate each other,

when [百官 the administration] is in chaos
and it's impossible to [智解 keep ego in check],

when accusations are made
and it's impossible to see reason,

when the accused are wronged
and refuse to accept responsibility,

that's when masters have to work even harder,
servants get even more complacent.

是以代大匠斲者
希有不傷其手

So those who would carve with the great craftsman's blade
rarely don't cut their hands.
