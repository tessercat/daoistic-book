The handsome young man asked Yangzi,
What do you think of people who
love life
and take care of their bodies
so they won't die?
孟孫陽問楊子曰
有人於此
貴生
愛身
以蘄不死可乎

Thinking you won't die is irrational.
曰理无不死

What about trying to prolong life?
以蘄久生可乎

Clinging to life is irrational.
The value of life isn't how long it lasts,
the love of self isn't how healthy you are.
And why prolong life?
The five senses turn from pleasure to pain,
the four limbs from fit to infirm,
a life's work from joy to sorrow.
Out of touch with changing times,
you've heard it before,
seen it before,
done it before.
After a hundred years, you'll be sick and tired.
Why prolong such sorrow?
曰理无久生
生非貴之所能存
身非愛之所能厚
且久生奚為
五情好惡古猶今也
四體安危古猶今也
世事樂苦古猶今也
變易治亂古猶今也
既聞之矣
既見之矣
既更之矣
百年猶厭其多
況久生之苦也乎

The young man replied,
When you put it like that,
dying young is better than getting old,
so I might as well just slit my own throat,
fall into the fire,
get it over with.
孟孫陽曰
若然
速亡愈於久生
則踐鋒刃
入湯火
得所志矣

Yangzi replied,
That's not what I'm saying.
You're alive,
so surrender to life and embrace it.
Want what it gives you
so you're resigned to death.
You're going to die,
so surrender to death and embrace it.
Go where it takes you
so you're free to move on.
There's nothing that doesn't give up,
nothing that doesn't hold on.
Why hurry or delay
the comforting call?
楊子曰
不然
既生
則廢而任之
究其所欲
以俟於死
將死
則廢而任之
究其所之
以放於盡
无不廢
无不任
何遽遟
速於其閒乎
