This is my first crack at Liezi.
I think I love it.

孟孫 appears as a student
in other texts,
but only in _Liezi_ as 孟孫陽.
In any case,
I take this passage as
elder Yangzi's advice
to a handsome,
healthy young man
as they chat
by Yangzi's fire.

I started looking at this passage
because it shares the term 貴生
with [chapter 75](/studies/75)
of the _Dao De Jing_.
I'm guessing that these characters,
along with 愛, 身 and 厚,
are part of the vocabulary of
immortality (不死)
and life extension (久生).

I'm thinking of 愛身
as the kind of self-nourishment
we still do today
to keep fit and healthy
like exercising and eating well,
but I think the term
probably also applied to
magical self-nourishment regimens
like breath work,
acupuncture,
or alchemy.
Now as then,
the term probably also covers
at least a few of the many
death-denying
medical marvels
of the modern age.

I've reversed 苦 and 樂
given the context
of the perennial process and result
of aging and decline.

I've also grouped
the last line
of the 古猶今 expressions
with the 既之 expressions
because I can't seem to make
it work as it is
in English.

The knife scene
isn't quite as explicit
in the original.

Xuanpin is 玄牝 of
[chapter 5](/studies/5)
of the _Dao De Jing_.
I'm thinking of 其閒
as the abode of 谷神,
the valley spirit,
the comforting,
accepting,
calm,
peaceful,
inevitable
female principle
of Daoist moral physics.
