This is
my first close look at Liezi.
Even when musing on death,
those old Daoists
were just so relentlessly
reasonable and upbeat.

孟孫 appears as a student
in other texts,
but only in _Liezi_ as 孟孫陽.
In any case,
I take this passage as
elder Yangzi's advice
to a handsome,
healthy young man
as they chat
by Yangzi's fire.

I started looking at this passage
because it shares the term 貴生 with
[chapter 75](https://ctext.org/dao-de-jing#n11666 "ctext link")
of the _Dao De Jing_.
I'm guessing that these characters,
along with 愛, 身 and 厚,
are part of the vocabulary of
immortality (不死)
and life extension (久生).
I'm thinking of 愛身
as the kind of self-nourishment
we still do today
to keep fit and healthy
like exercising and eating well,
but I think the term
might also have applied to
magical self-nourishment
of the alchemical kind.

I've reversed 苦 and 樂
given the context
of the perennial process
of aging and decline.
I've also grouped
the last line
of the 古猶今 expressions
with the 既之 expressions
in English
because I can't seem to make
it work as it is.

The knife scene
might not be as gory
in the original.

I'm not sure
what to make of 盡.
It appears in a couplet,
以俟於死 vs 以放於盡,
where 俟 and 放 are antonyms,
bind and release,
and if 死 and 盡 are synonyms,
does the couplet express
something like,
Resigned to death,
liberated from destruction?

Xuanpin is 玄牝 of
[chapter 6](https://ctext.org/dao-de-jing#n11597 "ctext link")
of the _Dao De Jing_.
I was thinking of
the last characters of the poem,
其閒,
as the welcoming
ease and comfort of 谷神,
the valley spirit,
the female principle
of Daoist moral physics.
A phoenix seems
a fitting symbol.
