Many of the words
in this poem
have double meanings
and definitions specific to Daoism,
so I see it as
yet another
description of the indescribable,
and in this case,
of what that looks like
when Dao is expressed
in human form.

I've tried to use simple English words
that don't stray too far from
a literal meaning,
though I've failed with 不可識.
The best word in English
is probably *inscrutable*
as the ineffable nature of Dao
and therefore of the good human being
who listens well,
keeps our secrets
and keeps harsh opinion
to themselves.

There's a lot of variation
in 若 expressions
between different versions
of the _Dao De Jing_,
and _Wenzi_ takes a crack too,
but I've stayed as close to Wangbi
as I could.

容 is the *acceptance* of the title.
It's the reserved consideration and good will
of 善士,
the skilled mentor,
the good teacher,
boss,
parent,
friend,
or of anyone with the grace
to be a positive influence
in the lives of others.

I love the versatility
of 蔽 in the punchline.
It can mean to shelter and protect,
but it can also mean to judge.
