The beauty and difficulty
of classical Chinese poetry
is that context is everything,
and the _Dao De Jing_
practically revels in ambiguity,
much like the good 士
this poem attempts to describe.

Many of the words
in this poem
have non-literal meanings
specific to Daoism,
so I've tried to use simple English words
that don't stray too far from the literal,
and that hopefully evoke
some of the more obscure significance
of the original terms.

There's a lot of variation
in 若 expressions
between versions of the _Dao De Jing_,
and _Wenzi_ takes a crack too.
I stayed faithful to Wangbi,
because, well,
you have to start somewhere.

容 is more like
*tolerant*
or *accommodating*
than *friendly*,
but thinking of the subject of the poem
as the kind of people
who make good friends
brought some focus to it
that settled my confusion
somewhat.
