Many of the words
in this poem
have double meanings
and definitions specific to Daoism,
so I've tried to use simple English words
that don't stray too far from
a literal meaning,
but that might evoke
some of the obscure significance
of the original terms.

There's a lot of variation
in 若 expressions
between different versions
of the _Dao De Jing_,
and _Wenzi_ takes a crack too,
but I've stayed as close to Wangbi
as I could.

容 is the *acceptance* of the title.
It's the reserved consideration and good will
of the skilled mentor 善士,
of the good
teacher,
boss,
parent,
friend,
of anyone with the grace
to be a positive influence
in the lives of others.

I love the versatility
of 蔽 in the punchline.
It can mean to shelter and protect,
but it can also mean to judge.
