# Acceptance

In the old days, a good mentor was
a bit subtle,
deeply gracious,
profoundly impenetrable.
古之善為士者
微妙
玄通
深不可識

Sometimes being misunderstood
is what made them so considerate.
夫唯不可識
故強為之容

They were careful, like a winter crossing,
and they were reserved, like a respectful neighbour.
豫兮若冬涉川
猶兮若畏四鄰

They were as polite as they were friendly,
but vague, like melting ice.
儼兮其若容
渙兮若冰之將釋

They were
as true as timber,
as wide as a valley,
as messy as mud.
敦兮其若樸
曠兮其若谷
混兮其若濁

Who else could slowly clean up by calming us down,
and who else could slowly steady us by keeping us moving?
孰能濁以靜之徐清
孰能安以久動之徐生

People with that kind of clout
aren't perfectionists.
保此道者不欲盈

Sometimes that
means just keeping us safe,
not fixing us.
夫唯不盈
故能蔽
不新成
