# Acceptance

In the old days, a good influence was
a bit subtle,
deeply gracious,
profoundly misunderstood.
古之善為士者
微妙
玄通
深不可識

Sometimes being misunderstood
is what makes people so friendly.
夫唯不可識
故強為之容

They were careful, like a winter crossing,
and they were reserved, like a respectful neighbour.
豫兮若冬涉川
猶兮若畏四鄰

They were as polite as they were friendly,
but vague, like melting ice.
儼兮其若容
渙兮若冰之將釋

They were
as true as timber,
as wide as a valley,
as messy as mud.
敦兮其若樸
曠兮其若谷
混兮其若濁

Who else could slowly clean up by calming us down,
and who else could slowly steady us by moving us forward?
孰能濁以靜之徐清
孰能安以久動之徐生

People with clout like that
aren't perfectionists.
保此道者不欲盈

Sometimes that
means letting us break down,
not fixing us up.
夫唯不盈
故能蔽
不新成
