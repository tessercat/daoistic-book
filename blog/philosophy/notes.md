內藏
Conceal inside.
Take in, absorb, assimilate, internalize.
The key term of the poem. 
In the Laozi saying,
it's what the wise do
and drums don't do.
So don't be a drum
and don't be a mirror,
be silent and obscure instead.
Or maybe,
Suck it up, buttercup.

天地, 陰陽 and 氣.
Heaven/earth, yin/yang/qi.
This poem is an incredible resource
for understanding
details of the physics of morality
central to the Daoist point of view. 

故
The reason that.
故 appears in Laozi's saying,
and throughout the poem,
in a pattern that makes a statement,
then explains why it's so.
So the first phrase of Laozi's saying
is more literally something like,
Drums don't absorb sound,
that's why they can make sound.
This seems backwards to me in English,
so I've turned these phrases around
so they seem more natural in English,
but preserve the meaning of the original.
