# Affirmation

Most people do the right thing
and keep it to themselves,
but some people can't do anything
without letting us know.
上德不德是以有德
下德不失德是以無德
Most people don't say anything
when it won't do any good,
but some people have a lot to say
about what they expect us to do.
上德無為而無以為
下德為之而有以為
But when kindness does something,
it does so for nothing,
and when duty speaks up,
it says the right thing.
上仁為之而無以為
上義為之而有以為
So when I say something righteous
and no one is moved,
I lose something important
when I get on my soapbox and preach.
上禮為之而莫之應則攘臂而扔之

I'm lost and I'm not doing the right thing.
I lack character and I'm no longer kind.
I lack compassion,
and that makes me irresponsible.
I've failed in my duty,
and I'm really not righteous at all.
故失道而後德
失德而後仁
失仁而後義
失義而後禮
Is it righteous
to inflame resentment
and weaken good will?
Am I some kind of prophet
when I take them for fools
and promise the moon?
夫禮者忠信之薄而亂之首
前識者道之華而愚之始

The answer is that true moral authority
lies in hope, not grievance,
in fact, not fiction.
So cancel one, claim the other.
是以大丈夫
處其厚不居其薄
處其實不居其華
故去彼取此
