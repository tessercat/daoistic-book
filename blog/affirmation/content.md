# Affirmation

Most people do the right thing
and keep it to themselves,
but some people can't do anything
without letting us know.
Most people do nothing
when there's nothing to do,
but some people need a reason
to do the right thing.
But when kindness does something,
it does so for nothing,
and when duty does something,
it does the right thing,
so when I say something righteous
and no one is moved,
I lose something important
when I roll up my sleeves
and give them a piece of my mind.
上德不德是以有德
下德不失德是以無德
上德無為而無以為
下德為之而有以為
上仁為之而無以為
上義為之而有以為
上禮為之而莫之應
則攘臂而扔之

I'm lost and I'm not doing the right thing.
I lack character and I'm no longer kind.
I lack compassion and I've lost my dignity.
I lack respect and I'm not righteous at all.
故失道而後德
失德而後仁
失仁而後義
失義而後禮

When the righteous pick fights and mock our humanity,
when grifters fleece rubes and promise the moon,
true moral authority
lies in faith, not grievance,
in reason, not glory,
so cancel one, claim the other.
夫禮者忠信之薄而亂之首
前識者道之華而愚之始
是以大丈夫
處其厚不居其薄
處其實不居其華
故去彼取此
