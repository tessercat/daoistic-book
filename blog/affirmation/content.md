# Affirmation

Most people do the right thing
and keep it to themselves.
Some people can't do anything
without letting us know.
上德不德是以有德
下德不失德是以無德

Most people don't do anything
when there's nothing to do.
Some people need a reason
to do the right thing.
上德無為而無以為
下德為之而有以為

But when good people do something,
they do so for nothing,
and when decent people do something,
they have a good reason.
So when my cause is righteous
but people aren't moved,
I lose something important
when I start making threats
and promise the moon.
上仁為之而無以為
上義為之而有以為
上禮為之而莫之應
則攘臂而扔之

I'm lost and I'm not doing the right thing.
I lack character and I'm no longer kind.
I lack compassion and I'm no longer decent.
I lack dignity and I'm not righteous at all.
故失道而後德
失德而後仁
失仁而後義
失義而後禮

When the righteous
have a legitimate grievance
but incite violence,
when visionaries
dream of glory
but make stupid decisions,
that's when moral authority
lies in faith, not grievance,
in reason, not glory.
夫禮者忠信之薄而亂之首
前識者道之華而愚之始
是以大丈夫
處其厚不居其薄
處其實不居其華

So cancel one, claim the other.
故去彼取此
