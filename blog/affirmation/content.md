# Affirmation

Most people do the right thing
and keep it to themselves,
but some people can't do anything
without letting us know.
上德不德是以有德
下德不失德是以無德
Most people do nothing
when there's nothing to do,
but some people won't do anything
unless they have an agenda.
上德無為而無以為
下德為之而有以為
But when kindness does something,
it does so for nothing,
and when duty does something,
it does the right thing.
上仁為之而無以為
上義為之而有以為
So when I do something righteous
and people don't know,
I lose something important
when I get on my soapbox and preach.
上禮為之而莫之應則攘臂而扔之

I'm lost and I'm no longer moral.
I lack character and I'm no longer kind.
I lack compassion and I'm no longer responsible.
I lack respect and I'm not doing the right thing.
故失道而後德
失德而後仁
失仁而後義
失義而後禮
Am I really that righteous
when I feed people's anger
and tear them apart?
Am I some kind of prophet
when I take them for fools
and promise the moon?
夫禮者忠信之薄而亂之首
前識者道之華而愚之始

The answer is that true moral authority
makes us stronger, not weaker.
It lies in fact, not fiction.
So cancel one to claim the other.
是以大丈夫
處其厚不居其薄
處其實不居其華
故去彼取此
