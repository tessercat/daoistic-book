The more I look at the _Dao De Jing_,
and Daoist poetry in general,
the more optimistic and upbeat it seems,
the more reasonable and humane.

In the first three couplets,
不德 is something like
*not moralizing*,
and 無以為 and 有以為,
respectively,
are something like
*has no reason to do*
and *has a reason to do*.
之 is the something
that does or doesn't
(need to) get done.

The poem riffs on
仁, 義 and 禮,
three of the five Confucian virtues (德).
All of these terms
have fairly standard
interpretations in English
that I've mostly just ignored.
Rectify me as you like.

德 is character.
It's doing the right thing,
and it flows directly from 道,
the important thing
that we lose (失) first
when we start ranting.

義 is the social contract.
It's the promise that we make
to each other
that lets our communities work.
It's our duty
to be kind (仁)
to each other
and to do the right thing (德).

忠信 is good will.
It's the community spirit
that the righteous (夫禮者)
scorn (薄)
when they
preach fire and brimstone (亂之首),
just as
道 is the truth
that false prophets (前識)
embellish (華)
when they
keep us in the dark (愚之始).

大丈夫 is literally
*head-man* or *elder*,
but *true moral authority*
works so well.

The poem presents a moral choice
between health (厚)
and decline (薄),
and between reality (實)
and fantasy (華).
Given the past decade or more
or world politics,
I'm especially fond of
*hope* vs *grievance*
for 厚 vs 薄
and more recently, of
*common sense* vs *conspiracy theory*
for 實 vs 華.
