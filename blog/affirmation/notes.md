The more I look at the _Dao De Jing_,
and Daoist poetry in general,
the more optimistic and upbeat it seems,
the more reasonable and humane.

The poem riffs on
仁, 義 and 禮,
three of the five Confucian virtues (德).
All of these terms
have fairly standard
interpretations in English
that I've mostly just ignored.
Rectify me as you like.

To make sense
of the remarkable density
of the first three couplets,
I've taken
不德 as something like
*not moralizing*,
and 無以為 and 有以為,
respectively,
as something like
*has no reason to do*
and *has a reason to do*,
and 之 as the something
that does or doesn't
(need to) get done.

From other passages in ctext,
攘臂 has the meaning of
rolling up your sleeves
to draw attention to yourself,
possibly in a threatening manner.
扔 is bragging.

失 is *fail* here.
It's introduced immediately,
then recurs later,
so it was clearly important
to the author,
but I can't make it work
in English.

I think *goodwill*
is a very good fit for 忠信.
It's what you weaken (薄)
when you inflame resentment (亂之首).

Ultimately,
the poem asks us to choose
between 厚 and 薄
and between 實 and 華.
Given the past decade or more
or world politics,
I'm especially fond of
*hope* vs *grievance*
for 厚 vs 薄.

I think *head-man* or *elder*
fit well for 大丈夫,
but *moral authority*
works too well.
