The more I look at the _Dao De Jing_,
and Daoist poetry in general,
the more optimistic and upbeat it seems,
the more rational and practical.

In the first three couplets,
不德 is something like
*not moralizing*,
and 無以為 and 有以為,
respectively,
are something like
*has no reason to do*
and *has a reason to do*.
之 is the something
that does (or doesn't)
need to get done.

The poem riffs on
仁, 義 and 禮,
three of the five Confucian virtues (德).
All of these terms
have fairly standard
interpretations in English
that I've mostly just ignored.
Rectify me as you like.

德 is character.
It's doing the right thing,
and it flows directly from 道,
the important something
that we lose first (失)
when we start
making threats (攘臂)
and promises (扔).

義 is the dignity and respect
that come from
being decent (義) and kind (仁),
and from doing the right thing (德).

The 者 couplet
is dense and concise.
I take it as something like:
The righteous (夫禮者),
legitimate (忠信) their grievance (薄)
yet violent (亂) their means (首).
The visionary (前識者),
principled (道) their dreams (華)
yet stupid (愚) their means (始 in Wangbi, 首 in Guodian).

In contrast,
wise elders (大丈夫)
reject (去) cynical, destructive solutions (薄)
and welcome (取) healthy, positive ones (厚),
and they reject (去) utopian fantasy (華)
and welcome (取) fact-based common sense (實).
That's how they
persuade kind (仁) and decent (義) people
to do the right thing (德).
