This poem seems to me
a common-sense exposition
on the the virtue
of not moralizing,
or on the impossibility
of doing the right thing
when you impose your own values
on others.

The poem riffs on
仁, 義 and 禮,
three of the five Confucian virtues (德).
All of these terms
have fairly standard
interpretations in English
that I've mostly just ignored.
Rectify me as you like.

The first section of the poem
(on the upward progression
of 德, 仁, 義 and 禮)
is remarkably dense,
and to make sense of it,
I've taken
不德 as something like
"not moralizing",
and there's some evidence for it
in ctext.

I've also taken
無以為 and 有以為,
respectively,
as something like
"has no reason to do anything"
and "has a reason to do something",
and 之 as
the something
that does or doesn't
(need to) get done.

From other passages in ctext,
攘臂 has the meaning of
rolling up your sleeves
to draw attention to yourself,
possibly in a threatening manner.
扔 is basically a humble-brag.

失 is "fail" here,
but I can't make that work in English,
so I've basically ignored it,
though its recurrence
makes it important
to the argument.

I think "goodwill"
is a very good fit for 忠信
in English.
It's what you weaken (薄)
when you rile people up (亂之首).

I think "head-man" or "elder"
is a good fit for 大丈夫.

Ultimately,
the poem asks us to choose
between 厚 and 薄
and between 實 and 華.
So many possiblities.
