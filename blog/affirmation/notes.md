The more I look at the _Dao De Jing_,
and Daoist poetry in general,
the more optimistic and upbeat it seems,
the more rational and humane.

In the first three couplets,
不德 is something like
*not moralizing*,
and 無以為 and 有以為,
respectively,
are something like
*has no reason to do*
and *has a reason to do*.
之 is the something
that does (or doesn't)
need to get done.

The poem riffs on
仁, 義 and 禮,
three of the five Confucian virtues (德).
All of these terms
have fairly standard
interpretations in English
that I've mostly just ignored.
Rectify me as you like.

德 is character.
It's doing the right thing,
and it flows directly from 道,
the important something
that we lose first (失)
when we start ranting (扔).

義 is the social contract.
It's the promise that we make
to each other
that lets our communities work.
It's our duty to be respectful,
to be kind (仁),
and to do the right thing (德).

忠信 is good will.
It's the community spirit
that the righteous (夫禮者)
scorn (薄)
when they
incite violence (亂之首),
just as
道 is the truth
that false prophets (前識)
embellish (華)
when they
incite mobs (愚之始).

大丈夫 is literally
*head-man* or *elder*,
but *true moral authority*
works so well,
and presents
a stark moral choice
between something like
a healthy, positive attitude (厚)
and an impoverished, cynical one (薄),
and between
fact-based common sense (實)
and conspiracy theories (華).
