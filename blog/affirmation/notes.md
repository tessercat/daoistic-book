This poem seems to me
a common-sense exposition
on the the virtue
of not moralizing.

The poem riffs on
仁, 義 and 禮,
three of the five Confucian virtues (德).
All of these terms
have fairly standard
interpretations in English
that I've mostly just ignored.
Rectify me as you like.

The first part of the poem
is remarkably dense,
and to make sense of it,
I've taken
不德 as something like
*not moralizing*,
and there's some evidence for this
in ctext.
I've also taken
無以為 and 有以為,
respectively,
as something like
*has no reason to do*
and *has a reason to do*,
and 之 as
the something
that does or doesn't
(need to) get done.

From other passages in ctext,
攘臂 has the meaning of
rolling up your sleeves
to draw attention to yourself,
possibly in a threatening manner.
扔 is bragging.

失 is *fail* here.
It's introduced immediately,
then recurs later,
so it was clearly important
to the author,
but I can't make
any of it work in English.

I think *goodwill*
is a very good fit for 忠信
in English.
It's what you weaken (薄)
when you rile people up (亂之首).
Ultimately,
the poem asks us to choose
between 厚 and 薄
and between 實 and 華.
Given the past decade or more
or world politics,
I'm especially fond of
*hope* vs *grievance*
for 厚 vs 薄.

I think *head-man* or *elder*
fit well for 大丈夫,
but *moral authority*
works too well.
