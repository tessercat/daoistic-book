老子曰：
鼓不藏聲，
故能有聲，
鏡不沒形，
故能有形，

The old guy used to say that
a drum makes sound
because it doesn't hide the sound,
and a mirror reflects an image
because it doesn't absorb the light.

金石有聲，
不動不鳴，
管簫有音，
不吹無聲。

A bell makes sound,
but doesn't ring till it's struck.
A flute makes music,
but there's no sound till it's played.

是以聖人內藏，
不為物唱，
事來而制，
物至而應。

So the wise take it all in
and don't play any tunes.
When there's work to do, they get it done,
and when something happens, they adapt.

天行不已，
終而復始，
故能長久，
輪復其所轉，
故能致遠，
天行一不差，
故無過矣。

The endless motion of the heavens
lasts forever
because when it stops, it starts again.
Its wheels travel far and wide
because they turn and come back to where they began.
Nothing's out of place
because the heavens move as one and don't wander.

天氣下，
地氣上，
陰陽交通，
萬物齊同，
君子用事，
小人消亡，
天地之道也。

When cosmic energy ebbs,
and earth energy rises,
yin and yang mix together
and everything evens out.
Straight shooters call the shots,
tyrants wither and rot,
that's the way of heaven and earth.

天氣不下，
地氣不上，
陰陽不通，
萬物不昌，
小人得勢，
君子消亡，
五穀不植，
道德內藏。

When cosmic energy doesn't ebb
and earth energy doesn't flow,
yin and yang don't mix
and everything seems hopeless.
Tyrants get their way,
democracies wither and die,
crops don't grow,
and the power of the way takes it all in.

天之道，
損盈益寡，
地之道，
損高益下，
鬼神之道，
驕溢與下，
人之道，
多者不與，
聖人之道，
卑而莫能上也。

The full moon wanes and the new moon waxes,
that's the Dao of the heavens.
High mountains tumble and hollows fill,
that's the Dao of earth.
Sacrificing the fat and giving to the poor,
that's the Dao of gods.
Not giving to those with plenty,
that's the Dao of human beings.
Humility that none can surpass,
that's the Dao of the wise.

天明日明，
而後能照四方，
君明臣明，
域中乃安，
有四明，
乃能長久，
明其施明者，
明其化也。

When the sky is clear and the sun shines,
there's light in every direction.
When authority is clear and subordinates shine,
only then is the world at peace.
It lasts for as long
as the four lights shine,
shining on those who shine the light
shining on their transformations.

天道為丈，
地道為理，
一為之和，
時為之使，
以成萬物，
命之曰道。

Cosmic Dao sets the scale,
Earth Dao brings order,
unity gives them balance,
time is their messenger,
by reconciling everything,
makes us talk of Dao.

大道坦坦，
去身不遠，
脩之於身，
其德乃真，
脩之於物，
其德不絕。

Great way wide open
repel self, doesn't separate,
cultivate it in self,
its virtue becomes real
cultivate it in others
its virtue doesn't end

天覆萬物，
施其德而養之，

與而不取，
故精神歸焉，

與而不取者，
上德也，
是以有德。

Sky covers everything
accept its morality and immitate it

jingshen returns to it.
because it gives and doesn't take,

those who give and don't take
high de
from this, produce de

高莫高於天也，
下莫下於澤也，
天高澤下，
聖人法之，
尊卑有敘，
天下定矣。

High none higher than heaven
low none lower than marsh
heaven high marsh low
the wise immitate them
respect low have hierarchy
world settles

---

地載萬物而長之，

與而取之，
故骨骸歸焉，

與而取者，
下德也，
「下德不失德，
是以無德。」

Earth carries everything and leads them

bone and flesh return to it
because it gives, but also takes from them

give but also take ones
low de
low de doesn't lack de
from this, there's no de.

地承天，
故定寧，
地定寧，
萬物形，
地廣厚，
萬物聚，
定寧無不載，
廣厚無不容，
地勢深厚，
水泉入聚，
地道方廣，
故能久長，
聖人法之，
德無不容。

earth inherits from heaven
so steady stable
earth steady stable
everything forms
earth bounty rich
everything collects
steady stable, there's no unsupported
bounty rich, there's no intolerance
earth power very rich
water wealth penetrates collection
earth way corner bounty
so can last
wise person imitate them
de there's no intolerance

陰難陽，
萬物昌，
陽服陰，
萬物湛，
物昌無不贍也，
物湛無不樂也，
物樂無不治矣。

yin rejects yang
everything is good
yang defers to yin
everything is calm
things good there's no insufficiency
things calm there's no unhappiness
things happy there's no disorder

陰害物，
陽自屈，
陰進陽退，
小人得勢，
君子避害，
天道然也。

yin destroys things
yang bends itself
yin advances, yang retreats
small people get power
prince escape harm
heaven way like that.

陽氣動，
萬物緩而得其所，
是以聖人順陽道，
夫順物者，
物亦順之，
逆物者，
物亦逆之，
故不失物之情性。

When yang energy moves,
everything settles and gets its place,
so the wise follow the yang way.
Those who follow others,
others follow them too.
Those who resist others,
others resist them too
because they don't forget the true nature

洿澤盈，
萬物節成，
洿澤枯，
萬物無節養也，
故雨澤不行，
天下荒亡。

stagnant marsh fills
everything gets its share
stagnant marsh drains
everything has no share to tend.
that's because rain marsh doesn't come
world waste destroy

陽上而復下，
故為萬物主，

不長有，
故能終而復始，

終而復始，
故能長久，

能長久，
故為天下母。

Yang is everything's master
because when it rises, it comes back down,

it can stop and start again
because it doesn't exist for long

it can last forever
because is stops and starts again

it becomes humanity's mother
because it can last forever.

陽氣畜而復能施，
陰氣積而復能化，
未有不畜積而能化者也，
故聖人慎所積。

yang chi builds up but returns as the ability to put into practice
yin chi accumulates and comes back as the ability to change

The wise are careful about what accumulates
because nothing can change without building up and accumlating.

陽滅陰，
萬物肥，
陰滅陽，
萬物衰，

故王公尚陽道則萬物昌，
尚陰道則天下亡。

yang extinguishes yin
everything is fat
yin extinguishes yang
everything declines

that's why king duke rather yang dao, then everyhing is fat
rather yin dao then ethe world is destroyed

陽不下陰，
則萬物不成，
君不下臣，
德化不行，

故君下臣則聰明，
不下臣則闇聾。

If yang doesn't defer to yin
everything is irreconciled
authority doesn't defer to subordinates
de reform doesn't happen

that's why when authority defers to subordinates, clever bright
when it doesn't defer to suboridingate, dark deaf

日出於地，
萬物蕃息，
公王居民上，
以明道德，

日入於地，
萬物休息，
小人居民上，
萬物逃匿。

sun rises above the earth
everything flourish stop
duke king sit people above
in order to brighten dao de

sun sets below the horizon
everything rest end
villains sit people above
everything runs and hides

雷之動也萬物啟，
雨之潤也萬物解，

大人施行，
有似於此，
陰陽之動有常節，
大人之動不極物。

at the sound of thunder, everything opens
at the moisture of rain, everything loosens

heroes get up and go,
something like this,

the action of yin and yang has regular portion
the action of heroes doesn't extreme things

雷動地，
萬物緩，
風搖樹，
草木敗，

大人去惡就善，
民不遠徙，
故民有去就也，
去無甚，
就少愈多。

Thunder shakes the earth
everything slows
wind shakes trees
grass trees fails

heroes repel evil attract good
people don't separate far
that's because people are repelled / attracted
repel isn't excessive
attraction small, even more.

風不動，
火不出，
大人不言，
小人無述，
火之出也必待薪，
大人之言必有信，
有信而真，
何往不成。

wind doesn't blow
fire doesn't emerge
heroes don't talk
villains have no story

fire's emergence, also receives fuel
hero's words also have truth
have truth, but real,
what past didn't finish?

河水深，
壤在山，
丘陵高，
下入淵，
陽氣盛，
變為陰，
陰氣盛，
變為陽，
故欲不可盈，
樂不可極。

yellow river deep
soil in mountain
hill mound high
above penetrates deep
yang chi ful
transforms to be yin
yin chi full
transforms to be yin
so desire should not fill
happy should not extreme

忿無惡言，
怒無作色，
是謂計得。

frustrated, there are no evil words
angry, there are no rise in color
that's called strategic advantage

火上炎，
水下流，
聖人之道，
以類相求。

fire rises heat
water lowers flow
wise person's way
by category each other ask

聖人偯陽，
天下和同，
偯陰，
天下溺沉。

Wise person cries yang
the world harmonize together
cries yin
the world drowns sinks
