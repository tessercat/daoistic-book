## 老子

Laozi, the old guy.

Not technically incorrect.
"Old guy" seems affectionate to me,
and I like to think of Laozi
as a kind and gentle grandfather figure
with a sense of humor,
not as a dour old master,
so I hope he would approve.

## 聖人

The wise.

## 動

Movement, action.

Bells are rung,
lightening strikes,
wind blows.

## 內藏

Conceal inside.

Take in, absorb, assimilate, internalize.

The key term of the poem. 

In the Laozi saying,
it's what the wise do
and drums don't do.

So don't be a drum
and don't be a mirror,
be silent and obscure instead.

Or maybe,
Suck it up, buttercup.

## 天地, 陰陽 and 氣

Heaven/earth, yin/yang/qi.

This poem is an incredible resource
for understanding
details of the physics of morality
central to the Daoist point of view. 

## Dao De

The Dao and De of the Dao De Jing.

Dao is the ineffable unity of what is,
and De is its expression,
its character and innate morality.

The middle of the poem
explains chapter 38.

## 應

## 故

The reason that.

故 appears in Laozi's saying,
and throughout the poem,
in a pattern that makes a statement,
then explains why it's so.

So the first phrase of Laozi's saying
is more literally something like,
Drums don't absorb sound,
that's why they can make sound.
This seems backwards to me in English,
so I've turned these phrases around
so they seem more natural in English,
but preserve the meaning of the original.

## 是以

In this way.

Similar to 故.
It explains what follows
in terms of what's just been stated.

## 物 and 

## 行

## 長 and 長久

## 君/君子/大人 vs 小人

## 明 and 化

## 域中
