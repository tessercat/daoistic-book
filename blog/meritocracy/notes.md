I started looking at this passage
because it contains a term (數窮)
that also appears in
[At the Mercy of Ants - Part 1](https://daoistic.ca/blog/ants-part-1 "Read At the Mercy of Ants - Part 1") in _Wenzi_
and [chapter 5](https://daoistic.ca/studies/5 "Read chapter 5")
of the _Dao De Jing_,
and it turned out to complement
the _Wenzi_ passage remarkably well,
almost a footnote
that explains the exact process
that takes the activist prince
from power to irrelevance.
In this passage,
I've interpreted 窮 as failure,
and I think it works quite well.

The passage is about the fate of
the master (主) as ruler or lord
who gives orders (詔) to subordinates (下), staff (官) and envoys (使)
who have to ask permission (請).
In my interpretation,
it's about the fate of
the master (主) as teacher
who explains (詔) to followers (下) and apprentices (官使)
who ask questions (請).

Since the second paragraph
contains two double negatives (無不)
and two triple negatives (未無不)
that don't work very well in English,
to make them more readable,
無不 becomes "everything"
instead of "there's nothing not".

The passage wraps up with statements by culture heroes
[Yao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Yao "Read about Yao"),
[Shun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Shun "Read about Shun")
and [Yu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu_the_Great "Read about Yu").
There aren't many helpful references
to 九陽 and 奇怪 in ctext,
and it's possible that these three lines,
and the Yu line in particular,
reflect some esoteric teaching
that's lost in time (or at least to me),
but I'd rather think they say
exactly what they seem to say
about the author's idea of good leadership.
Verbs and nouns get more specific line by line,
so Yao rules over everything
and transfers power
to an unrelated successor,
Shun is responsible for settled areas,
and Yu controls and transforms the north-east.
From this, I like to think that 九陽 and 奇怪
are the names of geographic features of the nascent
[Xia dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xia_dynasty "Read about the Xia dynasty"),
and not references to anything magical,
though, of course, I could be wrong.
