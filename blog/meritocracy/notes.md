I started looking at this passage
because it contains a term (數窮)
that also appears in
[At the Mercy of Ants - Part 2](https://daoistic.ca/blog/ants-part-2 "Read At the Mercy of Ants - Part 2") in _Wenzi_
and [chapter 5](https://daoistic.ca/studies/5 "Read chapter 5")
of the _Dao De Jing_,
and it turned out to complement
the _Wenzi_ passage remarkably well,
almost a footnote
that explains the exact process
that takes a micro-manager
from strength to weakness.

The last three lines
don't really flow with the rest,
and they seem quite dense,
but I'm fairly confident
I have the gist, at least,
and it was nice to read about
[Yao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Yao "Read about Yao"),
[Shun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Shun "Read about Shun")
and [Yu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu_the_Great "Read about Yu").

There aren't many helpful references
to 九陽 and 奇怪 in ctext,
and it's possible that these three lines,
and the Yu line in particular,
reflect some esoteric teaching
that's lost in time,
but I'd rather think they say
exactly what they seem to say
about the author's idea of great leadership.
If so, verbs and nouns get more specific line by line,
so Yao rules and transfers power
over everything under the sun and moon
to an unrelated successor,
Shun is responsible
for everything in settled areas
up to the border with the wilderness,
and Yu controls and transforms the civilized north-east.
From this, I like to think that 九陽 and 奇怪
are the names of geographic features of the nascent
[Xia dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xia_dynasty "Read about the Xia dynasty"),
and not references to anything magical,
though, of course, I could be wrong.
