# Meritocracy

Some masters think they're smart and everyone else is stupid.
They think they're the expert and everyone else is incompetent.
With a master like that, the idiots ask questions
and the guru explains.
人主自智而愚人
自巧而拙人
若此則愚拙者請矣
巧智者詔矣

But when the master explains, people ask more questions,
and questions become even more questions,
and eventually, people ask about everything.
Even if the master really is a genius,
it's impossible to know everything,
and since they don't know everything,
but people ask about everything,
the only way forward is to fail.
If you're a master like that and blame followers for failing,
how does that make you superior?
When you've failed and don't know you've failed,
suffering comes back as more suffering.
They call you the master of dead ends
and nothing you establish survives.
詔多則請者愈多矣
請者愈多
且無不請也
主雖巧智
未無不知也
以未無不知
應無不請
其道固窮
為人主而數窮於其下
將何以君人乎
窮而不知其窮
其患又將反以自多
是之謂重塞之主
無存國矣

That's why masters of the road ahead
inspire but don't control,
assert but don't explain,
reject belief, reject theory,
stay still and empty to be prepared.
They don't speak in anger
and don't take by force.
They set terms, establish facts,
let delegates decide for themselves.
They follow the road in ignorance
and let facts speak for themselves.
故有道之主
因而不為
責而不詔
去想去意
靜虛以待
不伐之言
不奪之事
督名審實
官使自司
以不知為道
以柰何為實

Yao asked, What does it take
to rule and hand over everything lit by the sun and moon?
Shun asked, What does it take
to be responsible for everything except the wilderness?
Yu asked, What does it take
to control the north and transform everything between Jiuyang and Qiguai?
堯曰若何而
為及日月之所燭
舜曰若何而
服四荒之外
禹曰若何而
治青北化九陽奇怪之所際
