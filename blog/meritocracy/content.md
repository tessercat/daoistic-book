# Meritocracy

Some leaders think they're smart and everyone else is dumb.
They think they're skilled and everyone else is incompetent.
With leaders like that, the stupid and incompetent ask questions,
and intelligent experts have all the answers.
人主自智而愚人
自巧而拙人
若此則愚拙者請矣
巧智者詔矣

When they have all the answers, they get even more questions,
and those questions become even more questions,
and eventually, there's nothing they don't answer for.
詔多則請者愈多矣
請者愈多
且無不請也

Even when leaders are skilled and intelligent,
they don't know everything.
And since they don't know everything,
they're obviously not without questions,
and they're well on their way to burning out.
If you're like those leaders and vent your frustration on subordinates,
how does that make you a good boss?
When you're tired and don't know you're tired,
problems come back as bigger problems.
They call you the master of dead ends,
and you're no good for the country.
主雖巧智
未無不知也
以未無不知
應無不請
其道固窮
為人主而數窮於其下
將何以君人乎
窮而不知其窮
其患又將反以自多
是之謂重塞之主
無存國矣

That's why the master of the road ahead
sets the agenda but doesn't implement it,
assigns responsibility but doesn't answer questions.
Rejects theory, rejects opinion,
stays still and empty and waits.
Doesn't criticize suggestions
and doesn't interfere.
Weighs words, investigates facts,
orders teams to organize themselves.
Leads the way in ignorance,
lets facts speak for themselves.
故有道之主
因而不為
責而不詔
去想去意
靜虛以待
不伐之言
不奪之事
督名審實
官使自司
以不知為道
以柰何為實

Yao asked, What does it take
to rule and hand over everything lit by the sun and moon?
Shun asked, What does it take
to be responsible for everything up to the border with the wilderness?
Yu asked, What does it take
to control the north and transform everything between Jiuyang and Qiguai.
堯曰若何而
為及日月之所燭
舜曰若何而
服四荒之外
禹曰若何而
治青北化九陽奇怪之所際
