與馬逐走
筋絕
不能及也

上車
攝轡
馬死衡下

伯樂相之
王良御之
明主求之

無御相之勞
而致千里
善乘人之賢也

Chase horses on foot,
tear a tendon,
it's impossible to catch up.

Mount a chariot
and take the reigns,
the team is content under the yoke.

Bólè trained them,
Wángliǎng harnessed them,
an [明主 enlightened master] called for them,

He did none of the work of training or harnessing,
but he drove them a thousand miles,
admired by every expert charioteer.

人君之道
無為而有就也
有立而無好也

有為即議
有好即諛

議即可奪
諛即可誘

The way of the prince
[無為 is to do nothing] but [有就 to accomplish something],
[有立 to stand for something] but [無好 not to favour anything].

A soon as he [有為 does something], he's [議 criticized],
as soon as he [有好 favours something], he's [諛 flattered].

As quickly as he's [議 criticized], he can be [奪 coerced],
as quickly as he's [諛 flattered], he can be [誘 convinced].

夫
以建而制於人者
不能持國

故善建者
不拔
言建之無形也

唯神化者
物莫
能勝

In the end,
[以建而制於人者 when the power to appoint is at the mercy of others,
it's impossible [持國 to maintain institutions].

Since [善建者 good foundations]
[不拔 don't crumble],
[言建之無形 promises to preserve them mean nothing].

Only [神化者 spiritual renewal],
[物莫 and nothing less]
[能勝 is capable of sustaining them].

中欲不出
謂之赖

外邪不入
謂之閉

中赖外閉
何事不節

外閉中赖
何事不成

From the inside, ambition doesn't emerge,
they say it's [赖 stable].

From the outside, corruption doesn't enter,
they say it's [閉 safe].

[When ambition doesn't tear it apart from the inside,
that means it's stable.]

[When corruption doesn't work its way in from the outside,
that means it's safe.]

Stable on the inside, safe from the outside,
when does it act irresponsibly?

Safe from the outside, stable on the inside,
when doesn't it get results?

故不用之
不為之
而有用之
而有為之
不伐之言
不奪之事

循名
責實
使自有司

以不知為道
以禁苛為主

Since he doesn't manipulate them,
doesn't force them,
but something motivates them,
and something makes them,
he doesn't [伐之言 doubt their promises]
doesn't [奪之事 do their job for them].

He [循名 obeys norms],
[責實 expects results],
orders them to [自有司 run the bureaucracy themselves].

He realizes that his own way is [不知 not to know how],
that his mandate is [禁苛 to prevent abuse].

如此
則百官之事
各有所考

When it's like that,
[百官 his administration]
is always well in hand.
