# At the Mercy of Ants - Part 2

Run with the horses and get trampled.
It's impossible to get anywhere.
Mount the chariot and take the reigns.
The horses settle under the yoke.
Bólè trained them,
Wángliǎng harnessed them,
and an enlightened master called for them.
He did none of the work of training or tackling, but he drove them a thousand miles,
admired by every expert charioteer.
與馬逐走筋絕
不能及也
上車攝轡
馬死衡下
伯樂相之
王良御之
明主求之
無御相之勞而致千
里善乘人之賢也

The way of the prince is to do nothing but to get it done,
to decide but not to play favourites.
As soon as he does something, he's criticized,
and when he does favours, he's courted.
If he can't take criticism, he can be bullied,
and if he can't resist flattery, he can be seduced.
人君之道無為而有就也
有立而無好也
有為即議
有好即諛
議即可奪
諛即可誘

In either case, when the power to appoint is at the mercy of others,
it’s impossible to maintain institutions.
Since good foundations don’t crumble,
promises to preserve them mean nothing.
He can keep them only through spiritual transformation.
夫以建而制於人者
不能持國
故善建者不拔
言建之無形也
唯神化者物莫能勝

They say he's reliable when he doesn't act impulsively.
They say he's confident when he doesn't let it get to him.
They feel safe when he's self-possessed, tolerant of others.
They succeed when he manifests confidence, embodies forebearance.
中欲不出謂之赖
外邪不入謂之閉
中赖外閉何事不節
外閉中赖何事不成

That's why he doesn’t command them,
doesn’t force them,
but something motivates them,
something makes them.
He doesn’t doubt their competence,
doesn’t do the work for them.
He respects rank and expects results,
orders the government to run itself.
He leads the way in ignorance,
he's the boss to prevent abuse.
故不用之
不為之
而有用之
而有為之
不伐之言
不奪之事
循名責實
使自有司
以不知為道
以禁苛為主

And just like that,
his team is well in hand.
如此
則百官之事各有所考
