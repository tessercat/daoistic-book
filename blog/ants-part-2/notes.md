I started looking at this passage
because it contains part of an obscure word (數窮)
that also appears in [chapter 5](https://daoistic.ca/studies/5) of the Dao De Jing.
I'm fairly sure that it means something like "find fault",
but there are so many ways to read the phrase it appears in
that I can't be sure of anything
except that it's about what happens
when a boss likes doing a servant's work.

As the beached whale is at the mercy of ants,
the activist prince is at the mercy of 有司,
office holders, bureaucrats, public servants,
maybe the deep state, who knows?
In any case, they eat him alive.

Doing a servant's work impairs a leader's 智,
which I've chosen to interpret as judgement.

The organization the prince leads is the 百官,
the hundred departments, in which the 有司 are employed,
and the word appears again in the punchline
at the end of the chapter.
Since the second half of the chapter
compares the enlightened leader
to a charioteer,
百官 is his team.

The person in question,
what I've interpreted here as prince,
is 人君, a leader of men.
While the word
doesn't necessarily imply gender,
and this passage
applies equally well
to any hierarchical organization of
superior and subordinate,
master and servant,
boss and employee,
I took the liberty
of being specific about gender and rank
to give the passage context
in a feudal past.
