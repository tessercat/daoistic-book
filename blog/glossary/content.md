# Glossary

Here are some notes on the vocabulary in
<a href="https://daoistic.ca/blog/philosophy" title="Blog post">The Philosophy of Heaven and Earth</a>.

Laozi is the pinyin spelling of 老子,
but it's often written Lao Tzu.
In either case,
it refers to the old master,
the purported author
of one of the foundational texts of Chinese civilization,
the _Dao De Jing_.
Every passage of the _Wenzi_
starts with a Laozi saying,
and though none of the introductory sayings I've looked at
come directly from the the _Dao De Jing_,
_Wenzi_ often quotes or paraphrases it.

Dao is 道.
It's usually translated as
way, pattern, or principle,
but I've left it as Dao in this passage.
It's Dao of the _Dao De Jing_,
the ineffable unity of all.
De, character and morality are all 德.
It's De of the _Dao De Jing_.
Dao De is 道德,
but if I were to offer an interpretation,
it would be something like
moral principles,
and the _Dao De Jing_ would be
 _The Classic of Moral Principles_.

Heaven, the sky and the universe are 天,
and earth is 地.

Yin and yang are 陰 and 陽
when they appear alone,
and energy is always 氣.
Negative energy and positive energy
are 陰氣 and 陽氣.
The passage's punchline
pairs yin and yang to a character (偯)
that isn't in Kroll (first edition),
and isn't well represented in ctext,
but that means something like a quiet sob.
I've interpreted these terms as
something like optimism and pessimism,
the moral expression of yin and yang.

Interpretations of 上, 高 and 下 
vary depending on context,
but keep the general sense of high and low.

Life and everything are 萬物,
literally the ten thousand things.
Something and anything are 物 when it appears alone.

Society and civilization are 天下.
It's literally something like beneath the heavens,
but it means
the kingdom,
the world,
the human realm.

The wise are 聖人,
the good person is 君子,
and the sovereign is 君
when it appears alone.
The good leader is 公王,
the powerful are 王公,
and the people are 民.
The great leader is 大人
and the tyrant and the troublemaker are 小人.

Muffle is 藏,
and responsible and compensate are 內藏.
As a verb,
內藏 is literally to conceal inside,
but it's also something like
take in,
absorb,
assimilate,
internalize.
It's what the wise do
that drums don't do,
and it's what Dao De does
when yin and yang don't mix
and the five grains don't grow.

Shine and enlightenment are 明,
mature and complete are both 成,
and the rhythm of life is 萬物節.

The gift of morality
that shines down from the heavens
and makes us moral
is 施,
a word that doesn't appear
in the _Dao De Jing_.

Progress and change are 化.
It's the enlightened moral transformation
that takes place naturally when we stay on 大道,
the great Dao.

The lord of life and the mother of civilization
are 萬物主 and 天下母.
[Chapter 25](https://daoistic.ca/studies/25)
and [chapter 52](https://daoistic.ca/studies/52)
of the _Dao De Jing_
also use the term 天下母,
but both chapters use it to refer to great Dao in general,
not to yang Dao in particular
as I think it's used here.

Giving and taking
and helping and harming
are both 與 and 取.
The passage quotes [chapter 38](https://daoistic.ca/studies/38)
of the _Dao De Jing_
and riffs on [chapter 77](https://daoistic.ca/studies/77)
to explore them as the answer to the question
of what makes something moral and what makes it immoral.

The waters are 澤,
literally a swamp,
but I've generalized it
when it's compared to 天, the heavens,
as something that the wise imitate.

Rice patties and canals are both 洿澤,
and though it's more literally wetlands,
the term is used in the context of
the life and death of human societies.

Water also appears in the passage
as the spring of water (水泉)
that earth power (地勢) generates,
as the rains (雨澤) that don't come
and the gentle rain (雨)
that accompanies thunder and helps life flourish,
as the destructive river (河水深),
and as the downward flow of water (水下流)
that either sustains society
or sinks and drowns it.

Wind and fire are 風 and 火,
the destructive forces generated
by thunder (雷) and words (言)
that great leaders manage to avoid.

The paragraph on thunder and wind
also plays on 去 and 就.
As verbs, they're literally leave and approach,
though repel and attract work as well.
In either case, I think they describe
the effect on something
of the potential difference
between yin and yang.

Behaving is 去就,
and Kroll says this is accurate by the Tang.
Many passages and phrases from the Tang-era _Wenzi_
have echoes in _Huainanzi_ (early Han),
but I can't find this passage in _Huainanzi_,
and it works so well in English as behave.
I also like to think of people behaving
as people repelled by this, attracted to that,
but oscillating in balanced and predictable patterns
of personal and social habits
not unlike what we see play out in the heavens.

Letting go of anger and being good is 去惡就善.

Not liking conflict and welcoming relief is 去無甚就少愈.
The same phrase also appears in
[Yan Tie Lue](https://ctext.org/yan-tie-lun/wei-tong#n52508),
but uses 尤甚 instead of 無甚
and clarifies grammar with particles.

Civilized is 不遠徙.
It's the opposite of migrants, nomads, wanderers, vagabonds,
or of anyone else with unsettled habits who leaves a place
and never comes back.
And since the wise are leaders who use yang Dao to
get people to settle down and get along
so they can cooperate
and get things done together,
I think civilized works quite well.
[Chapter 80](https://daoistic.ca/studies/80)
of the Dao De Jing
uses the term as an explanation
of why you shouldn't send people into danger,
and I think it works equally well there.

Making promises and exaggerating is 欲不可盈樂不可極.
The phrase is literally that
desires shouldn't be fulfilled
and pleasure shouldn't be extreme,
but in the context of a great leader speaking.

Cooperating is 以類相求,
literally sorting by kind.
