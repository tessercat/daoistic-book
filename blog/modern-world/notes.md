This poem
is another
description of the indescribable,
and in this case,
of what Dao looks like
as the skilled mentor,
the good teacher,
boss,
parent,
friend,
anyone
who has a positive influence
on the lives of others.

There's a lot of variation
in this poem
between different versions,
and some words have double meanings,
definitions specific to Daoism,
and entries in the _I Jing_,
so it's very, very obscure,
much like the
inaudible,
invisible,
ineffable influence
it describes.

I've stuck with Wangbi,
and where I can,
I've tried to use
simple English words
that don't stray
too far from the literal,
but since most of the vocabulary
of the poem
is so obscure,
I've also taken many, many liberties
to modernize it somewhat.
