# Setting the Bar

The old guy used to say that
in a healthy society,
promises are easy to keep,
work is easy to do,
tradition is easy to follow,
debts are easy to repay.

He meant that
being a student isn’t like being an administrator,
administrators aren’t teachers.
Teachers, farmers, builders, merchants,
we all have different callings,
separate concerns.

Farmers talk to each other about crops
and teachers talk about discipline.
Builders talk about building
and merchants talk about prices.
That way teachers don’t lose control
and builders don’t botch jobs.
That way farmers don’t waste effort
and merchants don’t lose money.
Happy with our lot in life,
we look different
and we have different skills,
but all we do easy jobs
and don’t get in each other’s way,
make mistakes and get corrected,
get it right and get credit.

Visionary,
forward-thinking people,
they’re geniuses,
but a healthy society
doesn’t rely on them for much.
Knowledgeable, ambitious,
argumentative, eloquent,
people know they’re talented,
but an enlightened master
doesn’t ask much of apprentices.

Since a decadent society is abusive,
out of touch with changing times,
its teachers are tyrants,
but a healthy society
doesn't have to control people.

Since we don’t hold our students
to impossibly high standards,
we shouldn’t expect institutions
to live up to our utopian ideals.

Since we shouldn’t rely too much on genius
and basic literacy
should be the norm,
and since government institutions
should be protected from corruption
and armed forces
should be subject to law,
we don't need heroes,
we need normal people,
because they know what’s real
and what to do about it.

Society today
has high expectations
and blames us when we don’t measure up,
gives us hard jobs
and punishes us when we don’t succeed,
sends us on dangerous missions
and executes us when we aren’t brave.

People confronted by these three realities
respond by polishing their stories
and lying to authorities,
by playing dirty tricks
and taking stupid risks.
Laws are harsh,
punishment severe,
but we can’t help ourselves.
A cornered animal responds by lashing out,
a cornered hen will peck,
desperate people lie.

That's what he was talking about.
