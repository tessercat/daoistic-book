老子曰
治世之
職易守也
其事易為也
其禮易行也
其責易賞也

The old guy used to say that
in a healthy society,
promises are easy to keep,
work is easy to do,
tradition is easy to follow,
debt is easy to repay.

是以人不兼官
官不兼士
士農工商
鄉別州異

故農與農言藏
士與士言行
工與工言巧
商與商言數

是以士無遺行
工無苦事
農無廢功
商無折貨

So being a student isn't the same as being a politician,
politicians aren't teachers.
Teachers, farmers, carpenters, merchants,
different callings, separate concerns.

Since farmers talk to farmers about granaries,
and teachers talk to teachers about behaviour,
and carpenters talk to carpenters about technique,
and merchants talk to merchants about prices,

teachers don't lose control,
carpenters don't botch jobs,
farmers don't waste effort,
merchants don't lose money.

各安其性
異形殊類

易事而不悖
失處而賤
得勢而貴

We're happy with our lot in life,
though we're all different shapes, all different sizes.

We do easy jobs and don't get in each other's way,
make mistakes and get corrected,
get it right and get credit.

夫先知
遠見之人
才之盛也
而治世
不以責於人

博聞強志
口辯辭給
人知之溢也
而明主
不以求於下

Visionaries,
forward-thinking people,
they're geniuses,
but a healthy society
doesn't require much of people.

Knowledgeable, ambitious,
argumentative, eloquent,
people know they're talented,
but even an enlightened master
doesn't ask much of apprentices.

敖世賤物
不從流俗
士之伉行也
而治世
不以為化民

Since a decadent society is abusive,
out of touch with changing norms,
teachers are taskmasters,

but a healthy society
isn't trying to reform people.

故高不可及者
不以為人量
行不可逮者
不可為國俗

[Since unreachable heights
aren't taken to be student measure,
unachievable behaviour
shouldn't make institution norm.]

Since we don't hold people
to impossibly high standards,
we shouldn't expect political culture
to live up to our unrealistic expectations.

故人才不可專用
而度量道術
可世傳也

故國治
可與愚守也
而軍旅
可以法同也

不待古之英俊
而人自足者
因其所有
而並用之

Since we shouldn't rely exclusively on genius
and the standards of a liberal arts education
should be [世傳 transmitted to society],

and since government institutions
should be protected from fools
and armed forces
should be subject to law,

we don't need mythic heroes of the past,
but normal people,
because they know what's real
and what to do about it.

末世之法
高為量
而罪不及也
重為任
而罰不勝也
危為其難
而誅不敢也

民困於三責
飾智
而詐上
犯邪
而行危

雖峻法
嚴刑
不能禁其姦

獸窮即觸，
鳥窮即啄，
人窮即詐，

此之謂也。

[high makes expectations
but punish, not reached,
heavy makes burdens
and punish, not win,
precarious makes its dangers
and execute, not dare.]

Society today
[高為量 has high expectations]
and blames us when [及 we don't measure up],
[重為任 gives us hard jobs]
and punishes us when [勝 we don't succeed],
[危為其難 send us on dangerous missions]
and executes us when [敢 we aren't brave].

People are trapped by these three [責 realities].
We respond
by polishing our stories
and lying to authorities,
by playing dirty tricks
and taking stupid risks.

Rules are strict,
penalties harsh,
but we can't help ourselves.

A cornered animal responds by lashing out,
a cornered hen will peck,
desperate people lie.

This is what he meant.
